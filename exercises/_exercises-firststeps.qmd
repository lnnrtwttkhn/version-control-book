To learn Git effectively, it makes sense to practice version control by implementing it on your own small project.
For the purpose of this guide, we will start off with a small project that only involves plain-text files.
You don't need to know any programming language like R or Python.
So while reading this chapter and using the commands along, **your task** is to:

:memo: Create a folder called `recipes` and initialize it as a Git repository. <br>
:memo: Create a plain text file called `recipes.txt` in this folder. <br>
:memo: **Add a recipe** in this file. <br> 

This can be the recipe for your favorite dish or an [unusual AI-generated recipe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/pak-n-save-savey-meal-bot-ai-app-malfunction-recipes).
:memo: Stage and commit your changes to the file

Please **keep this project directory**!
This guide will continue to use your recipe project as an example in following chapters.

There are several terms in these instructions that might be unfamiliar to you, for example "repository", "stage" or "commit".
Don't worry, you will learn about what these terms mean in this chapter.
Let's *git* started!
