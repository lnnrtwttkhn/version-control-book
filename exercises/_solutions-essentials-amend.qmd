1. Optional: Navigate into the `recipes` repository using `cd recipes` (or a similar path).
1. Make an additional change to the `recipes.txt` file.
In this example, `echo` is used to append text to `recipes.txt`.
Note that you can also use a regular text editor to do this.
1. Stage the changes using `git add`.
1. Amend the previous commit to include the new changes using `git commit --amend`.
In this example, the `--no-edit` flag is used to amend the commit without changing the commit message.
1. Check the commit history using `git log` to verify that the last commit message has not changed.
Here, we add the `--oneline` flag to show a concise summary of the past commits.
