1. Create a folder called `recipes` using `mkdir`.
1. Navigate to the `recipes` folder in the command line using `cd`.
1. Initialize a new Git repository in the `recipes` folder using `git init`.
1. Create a new file called `recipes.txt` using `touch`.
1. Add a short recipe to `recipes.txt` using `cat`.
1. Stage the new `recipes.txt` file using `git add`.
1. Commit the changes in `recipes.txt` with a descriptive commit message using `git commit`.
1. Make an additional change to the `recipes.txt` file using `echo`.
1. Stage the changes using `git add`.
1. Amend the previous commit to include the new changes without changing the commit message using `git commit --amend --no-edit`.
1. Download an image from the internet using `wget`.
1. Add `*.jpg` to `.gitignore` file to ignore all files that end with the `.jpg` file extension.
This command will create the `.gitignore` file if it does not exist yet.
1. Stage all changes using `git add --all`.
This command should generally be avoided as it may lead to staging and committing changes that should not added to the repository's history.
Here, we use it to demonstrate that only the `.gitignore` will be staged but not the pasta image file because it is ignored.
1. Commit the changes in `.gitignore` with a descriptive commit message using `git commit`.
