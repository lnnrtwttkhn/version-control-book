1. Navigate into the `recipes` subfolder using `cd recipes` (or a similar path).
1. Initialize a new Git repository in the `recipes` folder using `git init`.
1. Create a new file called `recipes.txt` using `touch`.
Note that you can also use a regular text editor to do this.
1. Add a *short* recipe to `recipes.txt`.
In this example, `cat` is used to add text to `recipes.txt`.
This command would also create the file if `recipes.txt` wouldn't exist yet.
Note that you can also use a regular text editor to do this.
1. Stage the new `recipes.txt` file using `git add`.
1. Commit the changes in `recipes.txt` with a descriptive commit message using `git commit`.
1. Make an additional change to the `recipes.txt` file.
In this example, `echo` is used to append text to `recipes.txt`.
Note that you can also use a regular text editor to do this.
1. Stage the changes using `git add`.
1. Amend the previous commit to include the new changes using `git commit --amend`.
In this example, the `--no-edit` flag is used to amend the commit without changing the commit message.
1. Download an image from the internet using `wget`.
This command download a picture of pasta from the internet and saves the output `-O` as `pasta.jpg`.
The `-nv` (or `--no-verbose`) argument makes the command output less text. 
1. Check the state of your repository using `git status`.
Git will notice the new file and list it as untracked.
1. Create a `.gitignore` file using `touch`.
Note that you can also use a regular text editor to do this.
1. Add `*.jpg` to the `.gitignore` file to ignore all files that end with the `.jpg` file extension.
This command would also create the file if `.gitignore` wouldn't exist yet.
1. Check the state of your repository again using `git status`.
The new file should disappear from the output and is not listed as untracked anymore.
1. Stage all changes using `git add --all`.
This command should generally be avoided as it may lead to staging and committing changes that should not added to the repository's history.
Here, we use it to demonstrate that only the `.gitignore` will be staged but not the pasta image file because it is ignored.
1. Commit the changes in `.gitignore` with a descriptive commit message using `git commit`.
