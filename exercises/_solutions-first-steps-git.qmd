1. If needed, navigate into the `recipes` subfolder using `cd recipes` (or a similar path).
1. Initialize a new Git repository in the `recipes` folder using `git init`.
1. Create a new file called `recipes.txt` using `touch`.
Note that you can also use a regular text editor to do this.
1. Add a *short* recipe to `recipes.txt`.
In this example, `cat` is used to add text to `recipes.txt`.
This command would also create the file if `recipes.txt` wouldn't exist yet.
Note that you can also use a regular text editor to do this.
1. Stage the new `recipes.txt` file using `git add`.
1. Commit the changes in `recipes.txt` with a descriptive commit message using `git commit`.
