**Create and merge a new branch**

1. Create a new branch called `feature`.
1. Switch to your new branch.
1. Add a new recipe to your recipes text file.
1. Switch back to the default branch (`main` or `master`).
1. Merge the `feature` branch with your default branch and delete the `feature` branch afterwards.

**Create and resolve a merge conflict**

Deliberately create a merge conflict by editing the same section of a file on two separate branches and attempting to merge them.
An example can be found [further below](#example-merge-conflict) in this chapter.
Resolve the merge conflict and delete the feature branch afterwards.
