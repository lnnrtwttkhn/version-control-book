###  Create and Merge a New Branch

1. **Navigate to the Rotterdam/Hamburg guide repository using the command line.**
2. **Create a new branch called `feature`.**
3. **Switch to the new branch.**
4. **Add a new section to your `placeholder.qmd` file, such as a description of another favorite caf√© or a local attraction in Rotterdam or Hamburg.**
5. **Stage and commit the changes to the `placeholder.qmd` file on the `feature` branch.**
6. **Switch back to the default branch (main or master).**
7. **Merge the `feature` branch with your default branch.**
8. **Delete the `feature` branch.**

### Create and Resolve a Merge Conflict

1. **Create a merge conflict by editing the same section of `placeholder.qmd` on two separate branches:**
   - On the `feature` branch, add or modify a section in `placeholder.qmd`.
   - On the default branch, make conflicting changes to the same section of `placeholder.qmd`.
   
2. **Attempt to merge the `feature` branch with the default branch to create a merge conflict.**
3. **Resolve the merge conflict by manually editing the `placeholder.qmd` file:**
   - Decide how to integrate the conflicting changes, possibly by combining content or choosing one version over the other.
   
4. **Stage the resolved changes in `placeholder.qmd`.**
5. **Commit the resolved changes with a descriptive commit message.**
6. **Delete the `feature` branch afterwards.**
