### Amend a Commit

1. **Make additional changes to your `placeholder.qmd` file:**
   - Imagine you've added a favorite café in Rotterdam or Hamburg but forgot to include the neighborhood it's located in.

2. **Stage the changes:**
   - Stage the `placeholder.qmd` file containing the café name and description but without the neighborhood.

3. **Amend the previous commit to include the new changes:**
   - After realizing you forgot to include the neighborhood, edit the `placeholder.qmd` file to add the neighborhood information.
   - Amend the previous commit to include this new detail in the same commit.

### Create a `.gitignore` File

1. **Create a random file that you want to ignore:**
   - Create or download a file named `random-file.docx` or any similar file to simulate an unwanted file in your repository.

2. **Check the state of your repository:**
   - Use Git to check the current state and verify that the `random-file.docx` is listed as an untracked file.

3. **Create a `.gitignore` file:**
   - Create a `.gitignore` file in the root of your repository.

4. **Add the random file to the `.gitignore` file and save:**
   - Add `random-file.docx` to the `.gitignore` file so that Git will ignore it.

5. **Check the state of your repository again:**
   - Verify that `random-file.docx` is no longer listed as an untracked file.

6. **Stage and commit the changes in `.gitignore`:**
