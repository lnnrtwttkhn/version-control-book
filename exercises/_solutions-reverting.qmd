1. Navigate into the `recipes` repository using `cd` (or a similar path).
1. Create a new branch called `feature/revert-exercise` using `git branch`.
1. Switch to the new branch using `git switch`.
Alternatively, you could have also done the two last steps with one command using `git checkout -b feature/revert-exercise`.
1. Make any change to any of the files in your project directory.
Here, we use the `echo` command to append text to the end of `recipes.txt`.
1. Stage your change using `git add <filename>`.
1. Commit your changes using `git commit -m "Commit message"`.
1. Retrieve the commit hash of the last commit using `git log`.
Here, we save the commit hash as variable and use this variable in the next step.
Normally, you would just run `git log` and find the hash of the commit that you want to revert.
(This code does this differently for automation) 
You can also use `git log -1` to only see your most recent commit.
1. Revert the commit using `git revert <commithash>`.
This will open your editor where you can specify a commit message for the revert.
If you use the `--no-edit` flag, Git will use a default commit message.
