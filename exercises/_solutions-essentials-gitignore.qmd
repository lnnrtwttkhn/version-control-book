1. Navigate into the `recipes` repository using `cd recipes` (or a similar path).
1. Download an image from the internet using `wget`.
This command download a picture of pasta from the internet and saves the output `-O` as `pasta.jpg`.
The `-nv` (or `--no-verbose`) argument makes the command output less text. 
1. Check the state of your repository using `git status`.
Git will notice the new file and list it as untracked.
1. Create a `.gitignore` file using `touch`.
Note that you can also use a regular text editor to do this.
1. Add `*.jpg` to the `.gitignore` file to ignore all files that end with the `.jpg` file extension.
In this example, `echo` is used to append text to `recipes.txt`.
Note that you can also use a regular text editor to do this.
This command would also create the file if `.gitignore` wouldn't exist yet.
1. Check the state of your repository again using `git status`.
The new file should disappear from the output and is not listed as untracked anymore.
1. Stage all changes using `git add --all`.
This command should generally be avoided as it may lead to staging and committing changes that should not added to the repository's history.
Here, we use it to demonstrate that only the `.gitignore` will be staged but not the pasta image file because it is ignored.
1. Commit the changes in `.gitignore` with a descriptive commit message using `git commit`.
1. Add `.DS_Store` to the `.gitignore` file to ignore it.
Again, `echo` is used to append text to `recipes.txt`.
Note that you can also use a regular text editor to do this.
Stage and commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.
