### Public Collaboration with Pull Requests (Using a Fork and GitHub Flow)
1. Find out what forking is
- Forking is a process where you create a copy of someone else’s repository under your own GitHub account. 
It allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

2. Fork the repository of another course participant (who is not your partner from the previous exercise)
- Go to the GitHub repository you want to fork.
- Click the Fork button at the top-right corner of the repository page.
- Select your GitHub account to fork the repository.

3. Create an issue, suggesting a missing activity
- Go to the Issues tab of your partner's repository on GitHub.
- Click New issue.
- Provide a title and description for the issue, suggesting a missing activity.
- Click Submit new issue.


4. Clone the forked repository into a sensible location on your computer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/forked-repo-name.git /path/to/your/forked/directory
cd /path/to/your/forked/directory
```

5. Create a new branch and create one or multiple commits “fixing” the issue that you opened

```bash
git checkout -b issue-fix-branch
echo "New Content" >> placeholder.qmd
git add placeholder.qmd
git commit -m "Add new activity to fix issue #1"
```

6. Push your changes to GitHub

```bash
git push origin issue-fix-branch
```

7. Create a pull request with your changes ( from the fork to the original repo) and refer to the issue in your pull request
- Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
- Click the Compare & pull request button.
- Ensure the base repository is the original and the base branch is main.
- Provide a title and description for your pull request.
- Refer to the issue by adding “Fixes #issue-number” in the description.
- Click Create pull request.
- Review Pull Requests in Your Repository

### Review pull requests that are created in your repository.
- Go to your repository on GitHub.
- Click on the Pull requests tab.
- Review the code and files changed.
- Use the comment section in the pull request to discuss and request any additional changes.

2. Close the pull request by merging the proposed changes.
- Once satisfied with the changes, click the green Merge pull request button.
- Click Confirm merge.
- Practice Collaborative Workflows on GitHub

### Protect Your Branch
