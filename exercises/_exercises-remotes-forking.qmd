1. Find out what [forking](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/github-advanced.html) is.
2. **Fork the recipes repository** of another course participant (ideally someone who is *not* your collaborator from the previous exercise).
3. **Create an Issue** in your new collaborator's repository (maybe their repository is missing a great recipe?).
4. Repeat the steps from the exercise on collaboration with remote repositories using the forked repository:
    1. **Clone** the *forked* repository into a sensible location on your computer.
    2. **Create a new branch** and create **one or multiple commits** "fixing" the Issue that you opened.
    If available, follow the **contributing guide** of your collaborator's repository.
    3. **Push** your changes to the remote repository.
    4. **Create a pull / merge request** with your changes (hint: from the forked to the original repository) and **refer to the Issue** in your pull / merge request.
