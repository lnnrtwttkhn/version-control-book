1. Find out what [forking](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/github-advanced.html) is.
2. **Fork the project repository** of the course instructor or another course participant (ideally, someone who is *not* your collaborator from the previous exercise).
3. **Create an Issue** in your new collaborator's repository, indicating an entry that you think is still missing in their repository.
4. Repeat the steps from the exercise on collaboration with remote repositories using the forked repository:
    1. **Clone** the *forked* repository to a sensible location on your computer.
    2. **Create a new branch** and make **one or multiple commits** "fixing" the Issue that you opened.
       If available, follow the **contributing guide** of your collaborator's repository.
    3. **Push** your changes to the remote repository.
    4. **Create a pull/merge request** with your changes (hint: from the forked to the original repository) and **refer to the Issue** in your pull/merge request.
