### Create and Merge a New Branch

1. **Navigate to the city guide repository:**
   - Use the command line to move to the directory containing your Rotterdam/Hamburg guide repository.

2. **Create a new branch:**
   - Create a new branch called `feature` using:
     ```sh
     git branch feature
     ```

3. **Switch to the new branch:**
   - Switch to the `feature` branch using:
     ```sh
     git switch feature
     ```

4. **Add new content to `placeholder.qmd`:**
   - Add a new section, for example:
     ```markdown
     ## Another Favorite Café in Rotterdam
     Hopper Coffee: A modern café located in the center, known for its excellent pastries and spacious seating.
     ```

5. **Stage and commit the changes:**
   - Stage the changes using:
     ```sh
     git add placeholder.qmd
     ```
   - Commit the changes with:
     ```sh
     git commit -m "Add new café section to Rotterdam guide"
     ```

6. **Switch back to the default branch:**
   - Switch to the main branch:
     ```sh
     git switch main
     ```

7. **Merge the `feature` branch with the default branch:**
   - Merge the `feature` branch:
     ```sh
     git merge feature
     ```

8. **Delete the `feature` branch:**
   - Delete the branch as it's no longer needed:
     ```sh
     git branch -d feature
     ```

### Create and Resolve a Merge Conflict

1. **Create a merge conflict:**
   - On the `feature` branch, add or change content in `placeholder.qmd`.
   - Example change:
     ```markdown
     ## Best Spot for Breakfast in Hamburg
     Café Paris: A beautiful café near the Rathaus, perfect for a luxurious breakfast.
     ```

   - On the main branch, make conflicting changes to the same section:
     ```markdown
     ## Best Spot for Breakfast in Hamburg
     Nord Coast Coffee Roastery: Known for its freshly roasted coffee and artisanal breakfast options.
     ```

2. **Attempt to merge the branches:**
   - Try merging the `feature` branch into the main branch, resulting in a conflict:
     ```sh
     git merge feature
     ```

3. **Resolve the merge conflict:**
   - Open `placeholder.qmd` and manually edit the file to resolve the conflict:
     ```markdown
     ## Best Spot for Breakfast in Hamburg
     Café Paris: A beautiful café near the Rathaus, perfect for a luxurious breakfast.
     Nord Coast Coffee Roastery: Known for its freshly roasted coffee and artisanal breakfast options.
     ```

4. **Stage the resolved changes:**
   - Stage the changes:
     ```sh
     git add placeholder.qmd
     ```

5. **Commit the resolved changes:**
   - Commit the resolved conflict:
     ```sh
     git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict by including both café recommendations"
     ```

6. **Delete the `feature` branch:**
   - Finally, delete the branch:
     ```sh
     git branch -d feature
     ```
