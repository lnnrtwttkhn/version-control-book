### Amend a commit

1. Make additional changes to your `recipes.txt` file.
1. Stage the changes.
1. Amend the previous commit to include the new changes.

For example, add a recipe without a title first, commit, then add a title and amend the previous commit to add the title change to the same commit.

### Create a `.gitignore` file

1. Create a `.gitignore` file.
1. Create a random file that you want to ignore, for example `random-file.docx`.
1. Add the random file to the `.gitignore` file, stage and commit your changes.
1. Save, stage and commit the `.gitignore` file.
1. :rocket: All macOS users: Let your repository ignore `.DS_Store`.
