1. Navigate into the `recipes` repository using `cd` (or a similar path).
1. Create a new branch called `feature/stash-exercise` using `git branch`.
1. Switch to the new branch using `git switch`.
Alternatively, you could have also done the two last steps with one command using `git checkout -b feature/stash-exercise`.
1. Make any change to any of the files in your project directory.
Here, we use the `echo` command to append text to the end of `recipes.txt`.
1. Stash your changes without adding a message using `git stash`.
1. Verify that the working directory is clean using `git status`.
Check that the output indeed indicates a clean working directory.
1. Apply the stash to your working directory using `git stash apply`.
1. Verify that your changes are restored.
Here, we use `tail -1 recipes.txt` to print the last line of `recipes.txt`.
