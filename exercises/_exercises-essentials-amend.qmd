1. If needed, navigate into the `recipes` repository using `cd recipes` (or a similar path).
1. Make additional changes to your `recipes.txt` file.
1. Stage the changes.
1. Amend the previous commit to include the new changes.
1. Check the commit history to verify that the last commit message has not changed.

For example, add a recipe without a title first, commit, then add a title and amend the previous commit to add the title change to the same commit.
