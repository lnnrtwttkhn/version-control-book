## Forking

Forking a repository on GitLab is similar to GitHub and allows you to create a personal copy of someone else's project under your GitLab account.
This copy includes all files, commit history, and branches, while maintaining a reference to the original repository. Forking is ideal for contributing to projects without needing direct access to the original repository. 
You can make changes, create branches, and push modifications to your forked repository. To contribute your changes back to the original project, you can submit a merge request, which is explained in more detail below.

### Creating a fork

1. **Navigate to the Repository**:
First, go to the repository you want to fork on GitLab. You can do this by searching for the repository or navigating to it directly if you have the URL.

2. **Click the Fork Button**:
On the repository page, locate and click the "Fork" button, typically found in the upper-right corner of the page. 
This action creates an identical copy of the repository under your GitLab account.
