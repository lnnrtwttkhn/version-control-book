## Forking

Forking a repository on GitLab is similar to GitHub and allows you to create a personal copy of someone else's project under your GitLab account.
This copy includes all files, commit history, and branches, while maintaining a reference to the original repository. Forking is ideal for contributing to projects without needing direct access to the original repository. 
You can make changes, create branches, and push modifications to your forked repository. To contribute your changes back to the original project, you can submit a merge request, which is explained in more detail below.

### Creating a fork

1. **Navigate to the Repository**:
First, go to the repository you want to fork on GitLab. You can do this by searching for the repository or navigating to it directly if you have the URL.

2. **Click the Fork Button**:
On the repository page, locate and click the "Fork" button, typically found in the upper-right corner of the page. 
This action creates an identical copy of the repository under your GitLab account.

3. **Choose Your Forking Settings**
After clicking the "Fork" button, you will be presented with the same options you have when creating a new gitlab repository, to configure your new fork. 
Start by deciding on the **Project Name**.
By default, the name of the forked project will be the same as the original repository, but you can change it if desired. 
The **Project Slug** will be automatically generated based on the project name, but you can also customize this URL-friendly version if needed. 
Optionally, you can add a **Project Description** to help others understand the purpose of your forked repository.
Next, set the **Visibility Level** of your forked project. 
You have three options: Private (only you and the members you invite can see the project), Internal (any signed-in user can see the project), or Public (anyone on the internet can see the project)
Finally, select the Namespace under which you want to fork the repository. 
This could be your personal namespace or any group or organization you belong to.
After configuring these settings, click the "Fork project" button to complete the process. Your forked repository will be created under your specified namespace with the chosen settings.

## Pull requests (Merge Requests)

In GitLab, pull requests are referred to as merge requests (MRs). 
They serve the same purpose as pull requests in GitHub, allowing for code review and integration into a project's codebase.

There are more ways to create a merge request on GitLab than the two explained below, you can check out the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html?tab=Branch+only) for more info.

### Creating a Merge Request from a Forked Repository

To create a merge request after forking a repository and making changes, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Your Forked Repository**:
Go to your forked repository on GitLab and make sure you are on the branch that contains the changes you want to propose.

2. **Open a New Merge Request**:
Click on the "Merge Requests" tab in the sidebar, then click on the "New merge request" button.

3. **Choose Branches**:
In the merge request interface, select the branch you made changes to in your fork (the "compare" branch) and the original repository's branch where you want to propose your changes (the "base" branch).

4. **Review Changes**:
Review the changes that will be included in the merge request.

5. **Create Merge Request**:
Click on the "Create merge request" button. Provide a meaningful title for your merge request and a description explaining the changes you made.

6. **Submit the Merge Request**:
Submit the merge request. 
The owner of the original repository can now review and approve the changes, merging your fork's branch into their repository.

### Creating a Merge Request from a Branch Within a Repository

In this scenario, contributors work directly within the original repository, creating a new branch for their changes. 
After completing the changes in the branch, they create a merge request from that branch to the repository's default branch (typically main or master). 
The workflow is similar to that of opening a merge request from a forked repository.
Follow the same steps as described above for opening a new merge request, choosing branches, reviewing changes, creating, and submitting the merge request.

## Templates

Project templates in GitLab provide a convenient way to create new projects with predefined files, directories, and configurations. 
Instead of starting a new project from scratch, you can use a project template that includes the necessary setup for specific types of projects, following best practices and common standards. 

To use a project template in GitLab, navigate to the "New project" page. 
Here, you will find various templates available, ranging from simple project setups to complex configurations for e.g. web applications or mobile apps.
Select the desired template, and you will be prompted to provide a name for your new project, an optional description, and select whether the repository should be public or private. GitLab then creates a new project based on the chosen template, complete with the predefined structure and files.
If you are member of a group, you can also see the templates which were created in the group.

## Project settings

The project settings in GitLab provide comprehensive control over your project's configuration, allowing you to customize various aspects to suit your workflow and security needs. These settings include:

In **General Settings**, you can manage basic information like the project name, description, and visibility level (public, internal, or private).
You can also enable or disable features such as issues, merge requests, wiki, and snippets, and archive the project if it's no longer active.

In **Visibility, project features and Permissions**, you can configure who can see your project and its contents. 
This section allows you to enable or disable project features and set permissions for different access levels (guest, reporter, developer, maintainer, and owner) to control user capabilities.

The **Repository Settings** section includes options for protecting branches and tags to prevent unauthorized changes, specifying who can merge or push. 
You can enforce push rules on commit messages, branch names, and file names for consistency, and monitor and manage repository size to ensure optimal performance.

In **Merge Request Settings**, you can set up merge request preferences, including choosing the merge method (merge commit, squash and merge, or rebase and merge).
You can also require conditions like approvals or passing CI/CD pipelines before merging and define who must approve merge requests.

For more detailed information on configuring repository settings, visit the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/)

## Gitlab specific features

GitLab offers several unique features and advanced functionalities that can be beneficial for managing large-scale projects and teams.
GitLab especially focuses on project management and security features, which are more comprehensive than the ones from GitHub.
u can check out the [GitLab documentation](https://about.gitlab.com/why-gitlab/) for more info.

### GitLab groups

GitLab groups allow you to manage multiple related projects and users in a centralized structure, simplifying collaboration and access control.
Groups enable you to set permissions, communicate with all group members, and manage projects efficiently. 
If someone has access to the group, they automatically get access to all projects within that group. 
For larger organizations, you can create subgroups to further organize projects and teams, with subgroups inheriting permissions from their parent groups.
Aditionally, you can implement consistent project templates and standards across all projects within the group.
GitLab also offers visibility and reporting features that help track progress and performance across multiple projects,

To create a group, go to the left sidebar, select "Create new" and "New group."
Enter the group name, URL path, and select the visibility level. 
Optionally, you can personalize your GitLab experience by selecting your role, specifying the purpose of the group, and inviting members.
For more detailed information about creating and managing groups, refer to the [GitLab documentation on groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/).
