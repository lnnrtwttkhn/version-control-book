# What are remote repositories

Remote repositories are versions of your project hosted somewhere on the internet or a network. 
You can set up multiple remote repositories, each usually either read-only or writable for you. 
Collaborating with others requires managing these remote repositories and pushing and pulling data to and from the repositories to share your work.


## {{< fa brands github >}} What is GitHub? 

GitHub is a popular web-based platform that hosts remote Git repositories.
You can use it in your browser without any downloads.
It's a collaborative environment for software development, allowing developers to work together, manage code, and track changes.
GitHub also offers project management and code review tools, making it great for open-source development and team collaboration.

## {{< fa brands github >}} Connecting to GitHub 

### Setting Account details

To be able to integrate Github in your workflow, you´ll need to authenticate your GitHub account.


```{bash}

git config --global user.name "Example"
git config --global user.email beispiel@example.com

```

In the [installation chapter](installation-setup.qmd) it is explained how to create an account on [Github.com.](https://www.Github.com).
If you did not use your GitHub account details for the setup you should change that now.

### Authentication

There a different ways to authenticate yourself. 
Each way with different pros and cons that we will not look at in depth.

#### HTTPS Personal Access Token

## Creating a Repository

### Starting from Scratch

Creating a new GitHub repository is a simple process. 
To create a new repository, click on the "+" sign in the top-right corner of the GitHub page. From the dropdown menu, select "New repository."
On the new repository page, enter a name for your repository and make sure the "Public" option is selected if you want it to be accessible to everyone. 
You should also choose to create a README file by checking the corresponding box.
Finally, click the green "Create repository" button at the bottom of the page to complete the creation process.
Once you have created the repository, you will find the README.md file in your repository. 
You can edit this file to provide information and details about your project. 
Whatever you write in the README.md file will be displayed on the front page of your project.
 
To add more files to your repository, click on the "Add file" button and choose whether to upload existing files or create a new file directly on GitHub. 
Remember to provide a descriptive commit message each time you add a new file or make changes. 
The commit message helps you keep track of the changes you've made and serves as a brief summary of the modifications made to the repository.

::: {.callout-tip title="Writing a README file" collapse="true"}
Keep it simple!
When you're working in any field, whether it's coding or studying stars, you'll likely use specialized terms that might confuse others.
So, use plain language and explain any unfamiliar words you use.
Share your project! 
Describe what you're doing now and what you plan to do in the future. 
This helps people understand your work and goals.
Introduce yourself! 
Tell people who you are and how they can reach you. 
It's great for networking and collaboration.
If you're not sure how to start, take a look at other people's README.md files for inspiration.

### Uploading an existing folder

To initialize an existing folder as a GitHub repository, you first need to create a new repository, like explained above.
You´ll then need to initialize the folder as a Git repository using `git init`.

If you have already done this, you can of course skip this.
To add your folder as a remote repository use the `git remote`command.

```{bash}
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

Now you are able to push your files to the remote repo using `git push`.

```{bash}
git push -u origin main
```
This pushes the local branch named "main" to a remote repository called "origin" while setting it as the upstream branch.
`-u`is used to set the upstream branch. 
It tells Git to remember the remote branch to which your local branch should be pushed in the future.

## {{< fa code-fork >}} Forking a Repository  

Forking a repository on GitHub allows you to create a personal copy of the project under your GitHub account. 
This separate copy includes all files, commit history, and branches.
Forking is commonly used when you want to contribute to a project without directly modifying the original repository. 
It enables you to make changes independently, create new branches, and push modifications to your forked repository. 
You can also submit changes to the original repository through pull requests. 
By clicking the "Fork" button on the repository page, you create an identical copy in your GitHub account.
Once the forking process is complete, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the git clone command.

## {< fa clone >}} Cloning a Repository {

Cloning refers to creating a local copy of a repository from GitHub onto your own computer. 
When you clone a repository, you download all of its files, commit history, and branches to your local machine. 
Cloning allows you to work with the repository locally, make changes, and push those changes back to the original repository if you have write access. 
It is commonly used when you want to contribute to a project or work on it independently. To clone a repository, you need the repository's URL from GitHub. 
You can find the repository's HHPS URL on the repository page, if you click on the green **code** button. 
Then use the terminal to navigate to the directory, to where you want to clone the repository.
Then use the `git clone` command followed with the URL of the repository.

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

Once the cloning process is complete, you will have a local copy of the Git repository in the directory you specified.
You can now work with the files in the repository, make changes, and commit your modifications locally.
Remember to use the appropriate Git commands like git add, git commit, and git push to manage your changes and synchronize them with the remote repository as needed.

## {{< fa code-pull-request >}} Pulling 

The `git pull` command is used to fetch the latest changes from a remote repository and merge them into your local branch. 
You can test this function by editing a file in your repo on GitHub and then use `git pull` to update your local file with the change made on GitHub.
To edit a file first click on it, in the repository. 
In the top-right corner of the file view, click on the pencil icon (Edit this file) to start editing.
Make the necessary changes to the file in the in-browser editor. You can add, modify, or delete content as needed.
As you make changes, GitHub automatically tracks your modifications in the editor, displaying them as "changes not staged for commit".
Provide a brief description of the changes in the "Commit changes" section at the bottom of the page.

In the relevant directory use the `git pull`command to update your local file with the change made on GitHub.

```{bash}
git pull
```

::: {.callout-tip title="git pull command flags" collapse="true"}
--rebase: Instead of the default "merge" strategy, use the "rebase" strategy to apply your local changes on top of the updated remote branch. This keeps a cleaner commit history by avoiding unnecessary merge commits.

--ff-only: Perform a fast-forward merge only. 
If the remote branch has new changes, Git will only update your local branch if a fast-forward merge is possible.
Otherwise, it will abort the pull.

--no-rebase: The opposite of --rebase. 
This flag tells Git to use the default "merge" strategy, even if a rebase would be possible.

--no-commit: Perform the pull, but do not create an automatic commit after merging. 
This allows you to review the changes before committing manually.

--verbose (-v): Provide more detailed output during the pull operation.
This can be helpful for understanding the actions Git is performing.

--squash: Instead of a regular merge or rebase, squash all the changes into a single commit.
This can be useful for cleaning up the commit history or grouping related changes together.

--autostash: Automatically stash local changes before pulling, then apply them back after the pull is complete.
This is handy when you have changes in progress and want to pull in the latest changes from the remote branch.

:::

## {{< fa code-pull-request >}} Pushing 

The`git push` command is like a reversed `git pull`, it is used to upload your local commits to the remote repository.
When you run "git push", Git examines your local branch and its commits, and then pushes those commits to the corresponding branch on the remote repository. 
Git will verify if your local branch is up to date with the remote branch. 
If there are new commits on the remote branch that you don't have locally, Git may reject the push and ask you to first pull the latest changes and merge them into your local branch to prevent overwriting or conflicts. 
It's important to note that you need appropriate access and permissions to push to a remote repository. 
If you don't have write access, you won't be able to push your changes.
If you don`t specify a branch, Git will push the one you are on in the moment.

::: {.callout-tip title="Common git push flags" collapse="true"}
-u or --set-upstream: This flag is used to set the upstream branch for the current branch. 
It is typically used when pushing a branch for the first time to link the local branch with a remote branch.

--force or -f: Force pushes the local main branch to the origin remote repository, overwriting any changes that may have been made to the main branch in the remote repository.

--all: This flag pushes all branches to the remote repository.

--dry-run: This flag simulates the push operation without actually pushing any data to the remote repository. 
It's useful for checking what would be pushed.

local_branch remote_branch: This syntax allows you to push a specific local branch to a specific remote branch.
Example: git push origin my_local_branch:my_remote_branch

:::

```{bash}
git push origin main
```

## Pull requests
Pull request serves as a request for code review and integration into a project's codebase, enabling collaboration and ensuring code quality before changes are merged.
When dealing with pull requests, there are two primary workflows.

**Pull Request from a Forked Repository:**

To create a pull request after forking a repository and making changes follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub by visiting https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>. 
Make sure you are on the branch that contains the changes you want to propose.

2. Click on Contribute and then "Open Pull Request".

3. In the pull request interface, choose the branch you made changes to in your fork (the "compare" branch) and the original repository's branch where you want to propose your changes (the "base" branch).

4. Review the Changes.

5. Click on the "Create Pull Request" button.
Give your pull request a meaningful title and provide a description explaining the changes you made.

6. Submit the Pull Request.

The owner of the original repository, can now approve the changes and thereby merge your branch into his.


**Pull Request from a Branch within a Repository:**

In this scenario, contributors work directly within the main repository, creating a new branch for their changes.
After completing the changes in the branch, they create a pull request from that branch to the main repository's default branch (e.g., main/master). 
The workflow for this, is the same as for opening a pull request for a forked repository.

## Template repositories
Template repositories, or repository templates, on GitHub enable you to create a repository that acts as a starting point for others.
Instead of beginning a new project from scratch, you can use a template repository that already includes predefined files, directories, and even code.
This simplifies the process of setting up new projects that share common characteristics or follow best practices.
Using a GitHub repository template is as simple as clicking the "Use this template" button on the template repository page, providing a new repository name and description, and then creating the repository with your desired settings.


## Alternatives to GitHub
