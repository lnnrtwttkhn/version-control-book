Check if you can access the "Terminal".

### Question: Where is the Terminal?

The Terminal can be found at `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app` or by searching the Spotlight for "Terminal". You may want to keep Terminal in your dock to find it more easily.

#### Option 1

Open the terminal and type:

```{bash}
git --version
```
If git is not installed you will get a prompt asking you if you wish to install it along with Xcode command line tools.
You may be asked for your administrator password.

#### Option 2

Download and run the installer from: https://git-scm.com/download/mac.
Hit ‘Continue’ through the prompts without modifying the installation destination or other settings.
You may be asked for your administrator password.
