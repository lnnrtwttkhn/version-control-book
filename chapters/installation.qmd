## Learning objectives

The task here is to get you setup 3 main components:
 
-   git - the version control software we will be studying

-   GitHub Account - access to the famed online git hosting service.

-   Text Editor - a text editor with good integration with the command line

## {{< fa brands git-alt >}} Git

### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

#### Option 1

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
### Question: Where is the Terminal?

The Terminal can be found at `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app` or by searching the Spotlight for "Terminal".
You may want to keep Terminal in your dock to find it more easily.
:::

Open the terminal and type:

```{bash}
git --version
```

If git is not installed you will get a prompt asking you if you wish to install it along with Xcode command line tools.
You may be asked for your administrator password.

#### Option 2

Download and run the installer from: [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).
Hit 'Continue' through the prompts without modifying the installation destination or other settings.
You may be asked for your administrator password.

### {{< fa brands linux >}} Linux

Check if you have git installed by opening your terminal and running:

```{bash}
git --version
```

If git is not installed, install it using your package manager, e.g., by running the following command in the terminal:

```{bash}
 sudo apt-get install git 
```

### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

Download the [Git for Windows installer](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
Hit 'Next' through the prompts without modifying the installation destination or other settings

### If your "HOME" environment variable is not set (or you don't know what this is)

Open command prompt (Open Start Menu then type cmd and press \[Enter\]) Type the following line into the command prompt window exactly as shown:

```{bash}
setx HOME "%USERPROFILE%"
```

Press \[Enter\], you should see SUCCESS: Specified value was saved.
Quit command prompt by typing exit then pressing \[Enter\]

## {{< fa brands github >}} GitHub

### Choosing a Github Name

Here are some tips for choosing a GitHub username:

```         
Incorporate your name.
Adapt your username from other platforms.
Choose a professional username for your future boss.
Opt for a shorter username.
Be unique and concise.
Avoid references to specific institutions.
Use all lowercase and hyphens for word separation.
```

## {{< fa align-left >}} Text Editor 

Sometimes, Git might ask you to write a commit message, and it can be annoying if you end up in an editor you don't like or don't know how to use.
The standard text editor is called **Vim**, which is widely known for being difficult to use. 
Therefore, it might be a smart move to consider switching to a different text editor. You can find more information about the challenges of using Vim (and some funny memes) [here](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/).

How to connect the text editor to git will be covered in a later chapter, but you can already download one.

Our Recommendation is [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/docs.php), which runs in the Terminal and is fairly easy to use.
However there are a lot of alternatives.

## {{< fa planet ringed >}} JupyterHub

In case the Installation process did not work on your device, you can access a remote environment using JupyterHub.
