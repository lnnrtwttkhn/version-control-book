# What is GitHub? {{< fa brands github >}}
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. 
It offers a collaborative environment for software development projects, allowing developers to work together, contribute code, and manage version control. 
It provides tools for issue tracking, project management, and code review, making it a powerful platform for open-source development and team collaboration.
GitHub has become a central hub for sharing and discovering code.
It makes sense to push your project onto Github, so other people can collaborate with you.

# Connecting to GitHub {{< fa brands github >}}
## Setting Account details
To be able to integrate Github in your workflow, youÂ´ll need to authenticate your GitHub account. 

In the the setup chapter you have set your Username and Email.
