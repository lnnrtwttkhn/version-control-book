## Communication

Communication in science often happens across a diversity of communication channels, including email, messenger apps like Slack, Mattermost or Discord and Project Management Software like Trello.
As illustrated in @fig-xkcd-chat-systems this can often lead to uncertainty about how to communicate about a project most effectively with whom.

## Overview

The basic idea is to manage your project next to your work (your code, your data) via a repository hosting service, in this case [GitHub](https://github.com).

- Discuss and plan your work in [Issues](https://github.com/features/issues)
- Propose changes to code or data using [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
- Manage access to your code and data with detailed [permissions and roles](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/access-permissions-on-github)
- Add documentation to your repository or in a separate [wiki](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis)
