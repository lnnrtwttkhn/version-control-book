## What are remote repositories?

A remote repository is **a version of your Git repository that is hosted on a server**, usually on the internet.
Unlike your local repository, which is on your personal computer, a remote repository can be a shared resource that allows multiple contributors to collaborate on a project. 
These remote repositories could be hosted on platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) or a private server.
In this chapter, we will mainly focus on the repository hosting platforms [GitHub](https://github.com/), mainly because it is the most popular platform for Git repositories with 100 million users (as of January 2023, [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), since it is a very popular alternative and offered by many academic institutions.

### Why use remote repositories?

One of the main reasons to use remote repositories is for **collaboration**.
If your Git repository only exists on your computer, no one else can access it.
Remote repositories provide a central location where team members can collectively work on a project. 
Whether contributors are across the room or across the globe, remote repositories make it possible for everyone to access the same set of project files and contribute to the development process.

Hosting a project on a remote repository also serves as a **backup mechanism**.
If a contributor's computer fails or their files get corrupted, they can always download (or "clone") a fresh copy of the project from the remote repository.
This ensures that the project's progress is not dependent on a single person's computer.
@fig-git-in-case-of-fire jokingly illustrates this point.

## Connecting to a remote repository hosting service

### Authentication

In order to connect your local Git repository with a remote repository, you need to establish an authentication method.
Depending on the platform there are different authentication methods available.
We introduce the most common authentication methods below, separately for each platform.

#### Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)

The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.
Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution.
For more details on SSH, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell).

You can read and write data in remote repositories like GitHub and GitLab using SSH.
When you connect with SSH, you verify your identity using a private key file stored on your computer.
We provide basic instructions below.
For more detailed instructions, see the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh).


::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands github >}} GitHub

GitHub authentication is needed to access and work with repositories that are stored on GitHub.
It is kind of like showing your ID to prove who you are before entering a restricted area.
It's necessary to make sure only the right people or programs can access and do things on GitHub, keeping everything safe and organized.

For security reasons it is no longer possible to authenticate yourself using only your GitHub email and password.
There are multiple authentication methods which offer different advantages and drawbacks.
In this section, we will briefly introduce one of the two most common authentication methods: Personal Access Tokens.

If you would rather use the [SSH](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) protocol for authentication, check out the [SSH documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

##### Personal Access Token (PAT)

Follow these steps to set a Personal Access Token (PAT; see @fig-pat):

1.  Log in to your GitHub account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/)

1.  Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner and select "**Settings**".

1.  In the left sidebar, select "**Developer settings**", then "**Personal access tokens (classic)**".

1.  Click "**Generate new token**".

1.  Give your token a **name**.
The name should help you to later identify in which context you used the token.
For example, you could add a short description of the machine that you generated the token for, for example `MacBook Pro 14-inch, 2021`.

1. Choose the desired **scopes**.
The scopes define the permissions of the token, or "what it is allowed to do" with your GitHub account and repositories.
For a normal use case, you should enable the scopes **repo**, **admin:org** and **delete_repo** for a full access.

1. Set an expiration date if needed.
You can also choose "No expiration".

1. Click "**Generate token**," and you'll be presented with your new token.

::: {.callout-important collapse="false" title="Make sure to copy the PAT as it won't be shown again!"}
Make sure to copy the Personal Access Token (PAT) as it won't be shown again!
The first time you try to interact with a remote repository, you will get asked for a password. 
Paste the PAT as the password into the terminal to proceed.

If you use Git Bash on Windows, your terminal will open a window where you can choose to authenticate yourself with a PAT.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false" title="FAQ: My PAT is not shown when I enter it into the terminal?"}
When authenticating with GitHub on macOS, you may notice that the password doesn't show up in the command line as you type it.
This is normal behavior to ensure security. 
You can still enter your password (or delete what you typed) even though it doesn't appear on the screen.
You can also copy and paste text, for example your PAT from GitHub.
When authenticating on Windows, a new window might pop up in which you can enter your PAT.
:::

![Screenshot of the personal access token settings](../static/github-pat.png){#fig-pat}

::: {.callout-tip title="Find out more: More details about PAT settings" collapse="true"}
**Expiration Date:**

When you create a Personal Access Token, you can specify its expiration date.
The expiration date is the date and time when the token becomes invalid and cannot be used for authentication anymore.
Setting an expiration date is a security measure to limit the time during which the token can be misused if it falls into the wrong hands.
Creating an expiration date for a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) is not strictly necessary, but it is considered a good security practice. 

**Scopes:**

When you create a PAT, you can choose the scopes to define what actions the token is allowed to perform. 
These scopes determine the level of access the token has to different parts of your GitHub account or repositories.

Here are some common scopes you might encounter when creating a GitHub PAT:

`repo`: 
This scope provides full control of private and public repositories, including the ability to read, write, and delete code.

`repo:status`: 
Grants access to commit statuses, allowing the token to read and set commit status for a repository.

`repo_deployment`: 
Enables the token to access deployment-related events and perform actions related to repository deployments.

`read:org`: 
Allows the token to read organization membership, teams, and repositories within an organization.

`user`: 
Grants access to user-related data, including user profile information.

`delete_repo`: 
Provides permission to delete repositories.

`admin:org`: 
Offers administrative access to the entire organization, including managing teams and repositories.

### Generating a new SSH key

1. Open the Terminal.
2. Insert the text below, changing the example email to your MPIB email address (or the email address that you use for MPIB GitLab):

```{zsh filename="Code"}
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

This will result into an output similar to this:

```{zsh filename="Output"}
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/user/.ssh/id_ed25519): 
```

3. When asked to "Enter a file in which to save the key," you can just press Enter to use the default location.

::: {.callout-caution title="SSH key already exists?" collapse="true"}

If the SSH key already exists, you will get an output similar to this:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
/Users/user/.ssh/id_ed25519 already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? n
```

If you don't want to overwrite the existing key, type `n` and hit Enter.
You can now use the existing key and move on with the next step.

:::

4. When prompted, enter a secure passphrase.

```{zsh filename="Code"}
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
```

::: {.callout-tip title="Do I have to provide a password for my SSH key?" collapse="true"}
If someone gets into your computer, they can use your SSH keys to access all systems that use those keys.
Adding a passphrase to your SSH key makes it more secure.
To avoid typing the passphrase each time you connect, you can securely store it in an SSH agent.
For more details, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases).
:::

### Adding a new SSH key to your MPIB GitLab account

1. Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.
The following command will copy the contents of the `id_ed25519.pub` file to your clipboard.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

```{zsh filename="Code"}
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

If the `pbcopy` command isn't working, find the hidden `.ssh` folder in your home directory, open the `id_ed25519.pub` file in your favorite text editor, and copy the contents to your clipboard.

## {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

```{zsh filename="Code"}
clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

If the `clip` command isn't working, find the hidden `.ssh` folder in your home directory, open the `id_ed25519.pub` file in your favorite text editor, and copy the contents to your clipboard.

## {{< fa brands linux >}} Linux

```{zsh filename="Code"}
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Then select and copy the contents of the `id_ed25519.pub` file displayed in the terminal to your clipboard.

Alternatively, find the hidden `.ssh` folder in your home directory, open the `id_ed25519.pub` file in your favorite text editor, and copy the contents to your clipboard.

:::

2. In the upper-left on MPIB GitLab, click your profile photo, then click **Preferences**.
3. In the sidebar, click **SSH Keys**.
4. On the right-hand side, click **Add new key**.
5. In the "Key" field, paste your public key.
6. In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key.
For example, if you're using a personal laptop, you might call it "Personal laptop".
6. Choose the "Usage type" for key.
Usually, you want to select "Authentication" here.
7. Optionally (and recommended), set an expriation date.
For example, this could be the date when your contract ends at MPIB.
7. Finally, click **Add key**.

## Creating a remote repository

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands github >}} GitHub

To create a new repository on GitHub, click on the "**+**" sign in the top-right corner of the GitHub page.
From the drop down menu, select "**New repository**".
On the new repository page, you are asked to enter some details about your repository and select a few options (see @fig-newrepo):

1. On the new repository page, as shown in  enter a **name for your repository**.
If you are planning to upload a local repository (a repository on your computer) to GitHub, it makes sense to choose the same name as on your computer.
Also, we recommend to avoid white spaces and use hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`) to separate words in your repository name.

1. You can also add an additional (optional) **description** to provide more details about the content of your repository.
The description will be shown on the main page of your GitHub repository and can help other users to understand the purpose of your repository.

1. Next, you can choose to make the repository **public or private**.
A public repository can be viewed by anyone worldwide even if they don't have a GitHub account.
It's like a public website on the internet.
A private repository can only be viewed by you and any collaborators that you specifically invite to your repository.
For more details about public vs. private repositories, see the box below.

1. At last, you can choose to initialize your repository with a few files, specifically a **README** file (find out more in the [next chapter](github-advanced.qmd#readme-file)), a template **`.gitignore`** file (see the chapter on ["First steps with Git"](first-steps-git.qmd)), or a **license** file.

1. Finally, click the green **"Create repository"** button at the bottom of the page to create a new repository with these settings.

::: {.callout-tip title="Find out more: Public or private repository?" collapse="true"}
When you create a new repository on GitHub, you can **control who can see it** by choosing if it's public or private.

If it's public, anyone on the internet can access it.
If it's private, only you, the people you specifically allow, and, for organization repositories, certain members can access it.
For further details, see the [chapter "About repository visibility"](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-repository-visibility) in the GitHub documentation.

If you have admin permissions for a repository, you can change its visibility.
This means you can later still make a public repository private and private repository public, if needed.
:::

![Screenshot of creating a new repository](../static/github-newrepository.png){#fig-newrepo}

#### Repository settings

To access the settings of a GitHub repository, go to the main page of the GitHub repository you want to configure and look for the "Settings" tab, usually located towards the right side of the repository's navigation bar.
Once you're on the repository settings page, you'll find various sections on the left sidebar that allow you to configure different aspects of the repository, such as "General," "Branches," or "Collaborators".

In the "General" section you can, for example, rename your repository or default branch, change the repositories visibility or delete your repository.
For a detailed guide on the repository settings, you can check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features).

#### Adding collaborators

In the "Collaborators" tab of the settings, it is possible to add accounts which can view or add changes your repository, even if it is private by entering their GitHub username or email address. 

## {{< fa brands gitlab >}} GitLab

Creating a new repository in GitLab is quite similar to GitHub.
GitLab calls *repositories* mostly *projects*, but you can use these terms interchangeably. 
After logging into your GitLab account, you need to follow these steps:

#### Create new project {.unnumbered}

Click on the **New Project** button, usually found in the dashboard.
Here you can choose to **create a blank project**.
Alternatively you can also create one **from template** or **import a project**.

#### Fill in project details {.unnumbered}

Next, fill in project details:
If you create a **blank project** you will have to fill in the following details.

- **Project Name**:
Enter a name for your project.
Avoid spaces and use hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`) instead.

- **Project Slug**:
This is the end of the URL of your project.
It will be auto-filled based on your project name, but you can edit it. 
It should be URL-friendly.
We recommend to use your project name to avoid confusion.

- **Description** (Optional):
Add a description to explain the purpose of your project.

- **Visibility Level**:
Choose the visibility of your project:

    - **Public**: Accessible by anyone (worldwide).
    - **Internal**: Accessible by any logged-in user.
    At institutional instances, this means everyone at your institute can see your repository.
    - **Private**: Accessible only by you and invited collaborators.

#### Initialize the repository {.unnumbered}

Like on GitHub, you can choose to initialize the repository with a `README file`, a .`gitignore` template, and a license file.
If you plan to push an existing local repository, do not initialize with a `README` or other files to avoid conflicts.

#### Create the project {.unnumbered}

Click the "Create project" button to create your new repository.

:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Don't initialize a remote repository with any files, if you want to upload a local repository!" collapse="false"}
If you want to upload your local repository to an remote repository, make sure that you create the repository **without initializing it with a `README` file** or any other files.
Initializing the repository with a `README` or any other files creates a commit in the repository. 
When you try to push your local repository, you will encounter conflicts because the histories of your local and remote repositories will differ.

To avoid this, create the remote repository empty.
You can add a `README.md` and other files after pushing your local repository.
:::

## Adding a remote to your local repository

Let's assume that you have a local Git repository on your computer that you want to upload to a remote repository hosting service.
To initialize an existing repository as a remote repository, you first need to create a new repository on your chosen hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), as explained above.

To add a remote repository to your local Git repository, navigate to your repository using the command line ^[:bulb: Tip: Use `cd` (details [here](command-line.qmd#moving-between-folders))] and use the `git remote` command:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands github >}} GitHub

```{zsh filename="Code (HTTPS)"}
git remote add origin https://github.com/user-name/repo-name.git
```

```{zsh filename="Code (SSH)"}
git remote add origin git@github.com:user-name/repo-name.git
```

Replace `user-name` with the repository's user name and `repo-name` with the name of the repository.

## {{< fa brands gitlab >}} MPIB GitLab

```{zsh filename="Code (HTTPS)"}
git remote add origin https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/user-name/repo-name.git
```

```{zsh filename="Code (SSH)"}
git remote add origin git@git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de:user-name/repo-name.git
```

Replace `user-name` with the repository's user name and `repo-name` with the name of the repository.

:::

::: {.callout-important collapse="false" title="HTTPS vs. SSH: Different remote URL!"}
Note, that depending on whether you are connecting to the remote repository via HTTPS or SSH, you have to use a different URL for your remote repository!
:::

Replace `<remote-repository-URL>` with the URL of your remote repository (HTTPS or SSH).
This command is essentially telling Git: 
“Add a remote repository named origin with the specified location (URL).”
After running this command, your local Git repository will be aware of the remote repository, and you can synchronize changes between your local repository and the remote repository.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false" title="What is `origin`?"}
The term "origin" is a conventionally used name for the default remote repository.
It's a standard name and we recommend using it, but you could also choose another name if you prefer.
For example, if you are connecting to GitHub, you could also replace `origin` with `github`
Specifying different names for the remote repository is useful (or even necessary) when you are configuring multiple remote repositories.
:::

### Checking configured remotes

If you want to check which remotes are configured for a local repository, run the following command:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
git remote -v
```

Below is an example output, in this case for the Git repository for this book.
This output basically tells you that one remote called `origin` is configured, it shows the URL for the remote repository on GitHub, and indicated that this remote is used both to fetch changes from and push changes to GitHub.

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
origin  git@github.com:lnnrtwttkhn/version-control-book.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:lnnrtwttkhn/version-control-book.git (push)
```

You can tell from the URL that in this case the remote was configured using SHH.

### Editing the remote URL

If you need to change the URL of an existing remote repository, you have two options: removing the remote and re-adding it, or setting a new URL directly.

#### Remove and re-add the remote

1. Remove the existing remote (assuming that it's called `origin`):

```{zsh filename="Code"}
git remote rm origin
```

2. Add the remote again with a different URL:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
git remote add origin <remote-repository-URL>
```

#### Set a new URL

You can also directly update the URL:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
git remote set-url origin <remote-repository-URL>
```

There is no feedback following this command.
To check if the new URL was set as expected, you can enter `git remote -v`.

::: {.callout-tip title="Find out more: Common `git remote` commands" collapse="true"}
`git remote`: Lists all remote repositories associated with the current local repository.

`git remote -v`: Lists remote repositories along with their URLs.

`git remote add <name> <url>`: Adds a new remote repository with the specified name and URL.

`git remote rm <name>`: Removes the remote repository with the specified name.

`git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>:` Renames a remote repository from `old-name` to `new-name`.

`git remote set-url <name> <url>:` Update the URL of the remote to a new repository URL.

:::

## Pushing

After you added a remote to your local repository, you are now able to "upload" your files to the remote repository using the command `git push`.
This command is used to "upload" your local commits to the remote repository.
When you run `git push`, Git examines your local branch and its commits, and then pushes those commits to the corresponding branch on the remote repository.

```{zsh filename="Code"}
git push -u origin main
```

The command above "uploads" the local branch named "main" to a remote repository called "origin" while setting it as the upstream branch.
`-u` is used to set the upstream branch.
It tells Git to remember the remote branch to which your local branch should be uploaded in the future.
After a successful push, you will get a message like this:

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
Enumerating objects: 17, done.
Counting objects: 100% (17/17), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (12/12), done.
Writing objects: 100% (12/12), 2.11 KiB | 2.11 MiB/s, done.
Total 12 (delta 9), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (9/9), completed with 5 local objects.
To https://github.com/username/repository.git
   fb3efef..8f50685  main -> main
```

The `git push` operation involves enumerating, compressing, and writing objects to the remote repository. 
The output indicates the progress of these steps, including delta compression, and concludes with a summary of the pushed branch and commit range.
In this specific example, changes from the local main branch (commit `fb3efef`) were pushed to the remote main branch (commit `8f50685`).

It's important to note that you need appropriate access and permissions to push to a remote repository. 
If you do not have write access, you won't be able to push your changes.
If you do not specify a branch and just run `git push`, Git will push the one "you are on" in the moment.

Git will verify if your local branch is up to date with the remote branch. 
If there are new commits on the remote branch that you don't have locally, Git may reject the push and ask you to first pull the latest changes and merge them into your local branch to prevent overwriting or conflicts (find out more about [pulling](#pulling) below).

::: {.callout-tip title="Common `git push` flags" collapse="true"}
`-u` or `--set-upstream`:
This flag is used to set the upstream branch for the current branch. 
It is typically used when pushing a branch for the first time to link the local branch with a remote branch.

`--force` or `-f`:
Force pushes the local main branch to the origin remote repository, overwriting any changes that may have been made to the main branch in the remote repository.

`--all`: 
This flag pushes all branches to the remote repository.

`--dry-run`:
This flag simulates the push operation without actually pushing any data to the remote repository. 
It's useful for checking what would be pushed.

`local_branch:remote_branch`:
This syntax allows you to push a specific local branch to a specific remote branch.
Example: `git push origin my_local_branch:my_remote_branch`
:::

## Cloning

Cloning refers to **creating a local copy of a repository from a remote hosting service on your computer**.
When you clone a repository, you download all of its files, commit history, and branches to your local computer.
Cloning allows you to work with the repository locally, make changes, and upload those changes back to the original repository (if you have write access).
Cloning is commonly used when you want to contribute to a project or work on it independently.
To clone a repository, you need the repository's URL from your chosen hosting service
You can find the repository's HTTPS URL on the repository page, if you click on the green **Code** button.
Then use the command line to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Then use the `git clone` command followed by the URL of the remote repository:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands github >}} GitHub

```{zsh filename="Code (HTTPS)"}
git clone https://github.com/user-name/repo-name.git
```

```{zsh filename="Code (SSH)"}
git clone git@github.com:user-name/repo-name.git
```

Replace `user-name` with the repository's user name and `repo-name` with the name of the repository.

## {{< fa brands gitlab >}} MPIB GitLab

```{zsh filename="Code (HTTPS)"}
git clone https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/user-name/repo-name.git
```

```{zsh filename="Code (SSH)"}
git clone git@git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de:user-name/repo-name.git
```

Replace `user-name` with the repository's user name and `repo-name` with the name of the repository.

:::

Once the cloning process is complete, you will have a local copy of the Git repository in the directory you specified.
You can now work with the files in the repository, make changes, and commit your modifications locally.
Remember to use the appropriate Git commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to manage your changes and synchronize them with the remote repository as needed (for details, see the chapter on [Git basics](first-steps-git.qmd)).
By default, `git clone` will create a reference to the remote repository called "origin", so you do not have to use `git remote` to create a remote repository.

Before you make changes to your newly cloned repository you should use the `cd` command to navigate into it.
This step of changing into the repository directory is crucial. 
Forgetting to do so may lead to confusion, as any Git commands you run will not affect the intended folder but rather the one associated with the current working directory.

To clone the repository into a different folder, you can specify the new folder name as an additional "argument" in the `git clone` command:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
git clone https://your-remote-repo-url.git new-folder
```

This will create a directory named `new-folder` and clone the repository into it. 

## Pulling

The `git pull` command is used to **retrieve the latest changes from a remote repository** *and* merge them into your local branch.
Effectively, `git pull` first runs `git fetch` (see below) to fetch the latest changes from the remote repository and then integrates these changes into the local branch, either using `git merge` (for details, see the [branches](branches.qmd) chapter) or `git rebase` (for details, see the section on [rebasing](intermediate-commands.qmd)), depending on the configuration.
In other words, `git pull` is a `git fetch` followed by a `git merge`.

You can test this function by editing a file in your repository on GitHub and then use `git pull` to update your local file with the change made on GitHub.
To edit a file, first click on it, in the repository.
In the top-right corner of the file view, click on the pencil icon ("Edit this file") to start editing.
Make the necessary changes to the file in the in-browser editor.
You can add, modify, or delete content as needed.
As you make changes, GitHub automatically tracks your modifications in the editor, displaying them as "changes not staged for commit".
Provide a brief description of the changes in the "Commit changes" section at the bottom of the page.

Now you can open up your command line once again, and in the relevant directory use the `git pull` command to update your local file with the change made on GitHub.

```{zsh filename="Code"}
git pull
```

If the pull is successful and there are no conflicts, you should see a message like this:
 
```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
Updating abc123..def456
Fast-forward file.txt | 2 +- 1 file changed, 
1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

The first part of the message indicates the range of commits that were fetched and merged.
In this example, it suggests that Git is updating from commit `abc123` to commit `def456`.
The "Fast-forward" message indicates that the local branch could be updated by moving the branch pointer forward, incorporating the new commits from the remote branch. 
This is possible when the local branch has not diverged from the remote branch, and there are no local commits that the remote branch does not have.
The next line shows changes in the file `file.txt`. The `2 +-` indicates that two lines were changed with one insertion and one deletion. The `+` represents an addition, and the `-` represents a deletion.
The last line of the message provides a summary of the changes.
It states that one file was changed, with one line inserted and one line deleted.

::: {.callout-warning title="Be aware which branch you are pulling!" collapse="false"}
A regular `git pull` incorporates changes from a remote repository into the **current** branch.
You can use the `git branch` command to verify which branch you are currently on (for details, see the [branches](branches.qmd) chapter).
If the current branch is behind the remote, then by default it will fast-forward the current branch to match the remote.
If the current branch and the remote have diverged, the user needs to specify how to reconcile the divergent branches.

`--ff-only`:
Perform a fast-forward merge only.
If the remote branch has new changes, Git will only update your local branch if a fast-forward merge is possible.
Otherwise, it will abort the pull.

`--no-commit`:
Perform the pull, but do not create an automatic commit after merging.
This allows you to review the changes before committing manually.

`--verbose` or `-v`:
Provide more detailed output during the pull operation.
This can be helpful for understanding the actions Git is performing.

`--squash`:
Instead of a regular merge or rebase, squash all the changes into a single commit.
This can be useful for cleaning up the commit history or grouping related changes together.

`--autostash`:
Automatically stash local changes before pulling, then apply them back after the pull is complete.
This is handy when you have changes in progress and want to pull in the latest changes from the remote branch.

## Fetching

The command `git fetch` is used to keep up-to-date with changes in the remote repository, *without* merging them into your local branch.
Instead, Git will update all your local tracking branches to the remote branch.
That means if you have made changes in your remote repository to a branch, for example called `feature`, `git fetch` will leave your local `feature` branch as it is, but will update your remote tracking branch called: `origin/feature`.
To view your remote tracking branches, you can use `git branch -r`.
After fetching, you can use `git switch` to review the changes on these branches.
If you want to integrate the changes into your local branch, you can either now use `git pull` to directly update your local branch, or use `git merge origin/branchname` when you are on your local branch that you want to update.

`git fetch` is arguably the safer option compared to `git pull` since it retrieves the changes from the remote repository without making any changes to your local working directory and staging area.
This allows you to review the changes fetched from the remote repository before integrating them with your local branch.

## Committing changes on the remote directly

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands github >}} GitHub

You can add or edit files directly on GitHub. 
This is particularly useful if you need to make quick changes without accessing your local repository.

#### Adding a new file on GitHub {.unnumbered}

1. Navigate to the desired repository on GitHub.
1. Click on the "Add file" button and select "Create new file".
1. Enter a name for your new file, including the appropriate file extension (for example, `example.txt`).
1. Add your content in the text editor provided.
1. Write a commit message describing the changes you are making.
1. Click on the green "Commit new file" button to save the new file to the repository.

#### Editing an existing file {.unnumbered}

1. Navigate to the desired repository on GitHub and locate the file you want to edit.
1. Click on the file name to view its contents.
1. In the top-right corner of the file view, click on the pencil icon ("Edit this file") to start editing.
1. Make the necessary changes to the file in the in-browser editor.
1. Provide a brief description of the changes in the "Commit changes" section at the bottom of the page.
1. Click on the green "Commit changes" button to save your modifications.
