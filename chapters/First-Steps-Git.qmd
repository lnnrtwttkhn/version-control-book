In this chapter, we will dive into the fundamental concepts and workflows of Git, providing you with a solid foundation to effectively manage your projects and collaborate with others. 
We will cover the fundamental concepts of Git, such as initializing a repository, making commits, and managing branches.
This Chapter is only going to be about local version control.

## Initializing a Folder as a Git Repository {{< fa folder-closed >}}

To create your first Git Repository you need a folder to initialize.
In the chapter [Command Line Basics](command-line.qmd) you have learned how to create an empty folder using the command line.
You can also just create one the regular way.


Now navigate to the directory or folder, using the Terminal, to where you want to create the Git repository. 
You can use the cd command to change directories.
Once you are in the desired directory, run the following command to initialize the folder as a Git repository.

```{bash}
git init
```

You should get the following output.

```{bash}
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/.../
```

Congratulations on successfully initializing your first Git repository! {{< fa champagne-glasses >}} 
Git is now able to track your changes in this Folder.

To be able to make changes you should create or move a file into your folder.
You can do this using the terminal

```{bash}
touch example.txt
```


## Staging and committing {{< fa file-export >}} 
Even though Git is now able to record the changes of your file, it will not do so automatically. 

Use 
```{bash}
git status
``` 
to visualize this. 
You should receive an output like this
```{bash}
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	example.txt
```
