# {{< fa code-branch >}} What are Branches?
Git branches are independent lines of development within a Git repository.
They allow you to work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.
Each branch has its own commit history, enabling parallel development and easy merging of changes between branches.
