## Why using Git from the command line?

You are most likely used to interacting with programs on your computer through graphical user interfaces (GUIs) where you can select options through graphical icons and visual indicators using the computer mouse.
However, computers have historically been controlled through text-based commands typed into command-line interfaces (CLIs) using the computer keyboard.
To this day, the command line has persisted as a reliable (and sometimes the only) way to interact effectively with computer programs.
Similarly, even though many GUIs for Git exist (for an overview, see the chapter on [Graphical User Interfaces](gui.qmd)), **Git is fundamentally a command-line tool**.
This is why comfort with the command line is a good basis for learning Git.
For more general advantages of the command line, see @tip-cli-advantages.

## Terminology

Before we begin with the basics of the command line, let's start by defining some key terms that you will frequently encounter throughout this book:

A **file** is a unit of digital data storage that can contain a variety of information, such as text, images or even programs. 
It is identified by a unique name and a file extension, which indicates the file's format or type (for example, `file.txt` for a plain text file). 
Files are organized within a file system, allowing users to create, access, modify, and delete them.

A **folder** is a container used in file systems to store and organize files and other folders.
Folders provide a hierarchical structure that allows users to group and manage files, making it easier to locate and navigate through data.

A **directory** is a more technical term for a folder, while **folder** is a user-friendly term for the same concept. 
In practice, the two terms are often used interchangeably and many operating systems have adopted the term "folder".

The **command-line interface (CLI)** is a text-based way to interact with computer programs.
Specifically, the term "command line" refers to the interface where users input text commands to communicate with the computer.
Most people primarily use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to work with programs on their computer, but historically, text-based interfaces were more common.
Often, the GUI can only access a limited set of features available through the CLI and some programs don't even have a GUI and can only be used through the command line.
This text-based interaction allows to perform various tasks, from running programs to managing files and folders.

The **terminal**, short for "terminal emulator", is the application or program that you open on your computer to access the command-line interface.
Terminals were used to connect to mainframe computers in the early days of computing.
The terminal program creates a window in which you can type commands and see the output from these commands.

The **shell** is a software that interprets the commands you type into the terminal.
It acts as a layer between you and the operating system.
The shell processes the commands and communicates with the computer's operating system to execute them.
It allows you to perform various tasks that your operating system offers, such as managing files, running and stopping programs, and changing system settings, all through text commands.
Examples of popular shells include [Bash]({{< var links.gnu-bash >}}) on Linux and macOS, and [PowerShell]({{< var links.power-shell >}}) on Windows.

In combination, in a typical scenario, you would open a terminal (the window), use the shell within that terminal to understand and process your commands, and interact with your computer through the command line interface provided by the terminal.
That being said, the terms "shell", "command line", "command-line interface (CLI)", and "terminal" are often used interchangeably and roughly refer to the same thing: a simple window showing a prompt and a blinking cursor (see @fig-cli).
In movies, when people hack into computers, they often type rapidly in this window.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Which \"programming language\" does the command line use?"}

As briefly described in the [section on terminology](#terminology), the default "programming language" of the command line is a version of the **Shell**.
Examples of popular shells include [Bash]({{< var links.gnu-bash >}}) on Linux and macOS, and [PowerShell]({{< var links.power-shell >}}) on Windows.
The program [Git for Windows]({{< var links.git-for-windows >}}) provides a Bash emulation that is used to run Git from the command line which generally behaves like Bash in Linux and macOS environments.

## {{< fa brands microsoft >}} Windows

![Logo of the Git Bash program on Windows (Source: [Git for Windows on GitHub](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4571183?s=200&v=4))](../static/git-for-windows-logo.png){#fig-git-for-windows width="20%"}

To use Git effectively on Windows, you need access to a Unix Shell environment, which is not natively available on Windows systems.
Unix Shells, such as Bash, provide the most comprehensive access to Git's features and are the standard tool for interacting with Git. 
This is why installing an emulator like Git Bash is necessary.
In this guide, we recommend using an emulator provided by [**Git for Windows**]({{< var links.git-for-windows >}}), which grants you access to both the Bash shell and Git commands.

For an installation guide, you can check out the chapters on [Installation](installation.qmd) and [Setup](setup.qmd).
Once you have installed [Git for Windows]({{< var links.git-for-windows >}}), you can open a terminal by launching the program called "Git Bash" from the Windows start menu.

## {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

![Icon of the Terminal program on macOS (Source: [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Terminalicon2.png), License: Public Domain)](../static/terminal-icon.png){#fig-terminal width="20%"}

On macOS, you can access your default shell through the **Terminal** program (see the icon in @fig-terminal) that can be found in the `Utilities` folder:
There are (at least) three different ways to get there:

1.    In the Finder, go to `Applications` > `Utilities` > `Terminal.app`
1.    In the Finder, select the `Go` menu > `Utilities` > `Terminal.app`
1.    Activate the Mac `Spotlight` search function, type `Terminal` in the search bar, and press the {{< kbd Enter >}} key.

You may want to keep the Terminal in your [Dock](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-apps-from-the-dock-mh35859/mac) to find it more easily, as shown in @fig-terminal-dock.

![Terminal icon in the Dock on macOS](../static/mac-dock.png){#fig-terminal-dock width="60%"}

On new Apple computers, especially those running recent versions of macOS, you might have to allow the Terminal access to certain files and folders after your initial commands.
If a prompt appears asking for permission, you will need to confirm it to continue using Terminal with access to these files.

::: {.callout-tip title="macOS Terminal: Bash or Zsh?" collapse="true"}

On an Apple computer running macOS Mojave or earlier versions, the default Unix Shell is Bash.
Unix is a family of operating systems serving as the basis for Linux and macOS with the inclusion of a command line interface (or Unix Shell) as a key feature.
For an Apple computer operating on macOS Catalina or later releases, the default Unix Shell is Zsh.
Bash and Zsh are both programs, which are command-line interfaces for interacting with an operating system.
Zsh is often considered better than Bash for its more advanced features and improved scripting capabilities.
It also has extensive community-contributed plugins and themes.
However, the change to Zsh was not a drastic shift for most users, since there a few practical differences.

To verify if your machine is configured to use a shell other than Bash, you can type the following command in your terminal window (you will learn about the command that is used here, `echo`, in this chapter):

```{zsh filename="Code"}
echo $SHELL
```

If the output is `/bin/bash` or a similar path, it means your default shell is set to Bash.
This is the most common shell on Unix-based systems, including macOS.

If the output is `/bin/zsh` or a similar path, it means your default shell is set to Zsh.

If the output is a different path, it indicates that your shell is configured to use a different shell program.
If your machine is configured to use a shell other than Bash, you can switch to Bash by opening a terminal and typing `bash`.

## {{< fa brands linux >}} Linux

To open a fresh terminal window on Linux, you can usually use a keyboard shortcut, which often involves pressing {{< kbd Ctrl >}} (`control`) + {{< kbd Alt >}} + {{< kbd T >}} simultaneously.
If this shortcut does not work, you can find the terminal application in your system's applications menu and click on it to open a new window.
Additionally, if you are already in a graphical environment, right-clicking on the desktop or within a file manager may offer an option to open a terminal in the current location.

## {{< fa rocket >}} UHH JupyterHub

If it is not possible for you to access a command line interface using your personal computer, you can use a remote solution with [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub).
JupyterHub is a web-based platform that allows multiple users to access an interactive computing environment on a shared server.

If you are a student at University of Hamburg, you can access a remote environment, using your university login credentials here:

<https://code.min.uni-hamburg.de>

Simply click on the link and log in.

Once you are logged in, you should be able to view the remote environment and create files using different programs like {{< fa brands r-project >}}, Python {{< fa brands python >}} or Java {{< fa brands java >}}.

![Screenshot of JupyterHub, showing the start screen.](../static/cli_jupyter.png){#fig-jupyter}

If you scroll down in the "launcher" window, there should be the option to open a terminal window.
Your remote environment will be mostly empty, but you can move around and manage files just like you could on your own computer.

![Screenshot of JupyterHub, showing the terminal.](../static/cli_jupyter_2.png){#fig-jupyter_2}

:::

## Opening the command line

When you open the command line, you'll see a prompt that tells you that the shell is ready for input.
Your terminal interface will usually show a message similar to the following prompt:

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
$
```

In the shell, the prompt is usually represented by the symbol `$` but it can look a bit different sometimes.
In our examples, we will use `$` as the prompt.
The important thing to remember is **to not type the prompt, `$`, itself when entering commands**.
Only type the command that comes after the `$` prompt.
For this reason, we remove the `$` prompt from all code examples in this guide.
Also, remember to press the {{< kbd Enter >}} key after typing a command to execute it.

After the prompt, you'll see a text cursor that shows where you can type.
The cursor can be a flashing or solid block, or it can be an underscore or a pipe symbol.
You may have seen a similar cursor in a text editing program.

Keep in mind that your prompt may look slightly different.
Usually, in popular shell environments, your username and the host name appear before the `$` symbol.
For example, your prompt might look like this:

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~$
```

## Navigating the file system

### Introduction

You are most likely familiar with using your computer mouse to click through folders in your file browser, or perhaps you use arrow keys and clicks in the File Explorer (on Windows) or Finder (on macOS) to manage your files.

The command line offers a different, one could say less intuitive, but very efficient and precise way to interact with your computer's file system.
Instead of relying on a graphical user interface, you use text-based commands to perform tasks like exploring the contents of folders, creating and deleting files, and moving between folders. 
### Directory and file structure

In a file system, directories (or folders) and files are organized hierarchically to enable the storage and retrieval of data.
Each level in the hierarchy is called a "level" or "depth".
In the context of file systems, the hierarchy of directories is often described as a parent-child relationship and folders are therefore often referred to as "parent directories" and "child directories" (for details, see @tip-parent-child-directories).

::: {#tip-parent-child-directories .callout-tip title='What are "parent" and "child" directories?' collapse="true"}

In the context of file systems, a "parent directory" and a "child directory" describe the relationship between directories (or folders).

- **Parent Directory:** This is the directory that is "higher up" in the directory hierarchy and contains one or more "child directories".
- **Child Directory:** A child directory is located "inside" or "below" a parent directory.
It is contained within the parent directory and is considered subordinate to it, like a child in a family is part of the larger family unit.

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
parent $ tree
.
├── child1
└── child2

3 directories
```

To visualize this hierarchy, you can use the `tree` command in the command line. 
The `tree` command generates a graphical representation of the directory structure, displaying the parent directory along with its child directories and files in a tree-like format. 
This makes it easier to understand the organization of files and directories within a specific directory.

**Note:** 
The tree command is natively available on Windows. 
For Linux and macOS users, you can install it via your package manager (for example, `brew install tree`, if [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is installed) to achieve the same.
:::

The **root directory** is the highest level in the hierarchy.
On Unix-based systems (including macOS and Linux), the root directory is denoted by `/`.
On Windows, it is typically denoted by a drive letter followed by `\` (for example, `C:\`).
While the fundamental concepts of directories and files are consistent across operating systems, there are some differences in folder structures between macOS (Unix-based) and Windows (for details, see @tip-folder-os-diff)

::: {#tip-folder-os-diff .callout-tip title="Differences in folder structures between macOS and Windows" collapse="true"}

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### {{< fa brands microsoft >}} Windows

On Windows operating systems, each drive, such as `C:` or `D:`, has its own root directory, denoted by the drive letter followed by a backslash, like `C:\`. 
Windows uses the backslash (`\`) as the directory separator.
The `Users` folder, which typically contains the personal folders of all users on the system, is usually located in the root directory of the drive where Windows is installed. 
The standard path to the `Users` folder is `C:\Users`.

To find or navigate to the `Users` folder in Windows, you can:

1. Use the tilde symbol (`~`; for more details, [see below](#tilde)): 
In Git Bash, you can use `~` to represent the home directory of the current user, which is typically `C:\Users\<username>`.

2. Navigate directly using the command prompt.
If your present working directory (use `pwd`; for details, see below) is at the root (`C:\`), you can directly navigate to the `Users` folder by entering the command: `cd Users`.
Alternatively, if you are not sure which drive you are currently on, you can switch to the `C:` drive by typing `cd C:` and then navigate to the `Users`folder with `cd Users`.
An example path to a file within the `Users` directory on Windows might be:

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
C:\Users\username\Documents\file.txt
```

#### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

On macOS the root directory is denoted by `/`, which is also used as the directory separator.
The home directory for a user is typically `/Users/username/`.
An example path on macOS could be:

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
/Users/username/Documents/file.txt
```

:::

:::

### Current working directory

The current working directory is the location within your file system where a user or an application is presently performing file operations or running commands.
The command `pwd` (short for "print working directory") will display the directory that the shell is currently focused on in your file system.

```{zsh filename="Code"}
pwd
```

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of this command executed in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash filename="Output"}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: zsh
#| code-copy: false
pwd
```
</details>

### Command not found

If the shell cannot find the program you typed as a command, it will show an error message.
This can happen if you made a mistake when typing the command or if the program for that command is not installed on your system.
For example, if you made a mistake when typing the `pwd` command, and accidentally entered `pws`, the following error message might appear:

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
pws: command not found
```

### Moving between folders

The `cd` command is used to change the current working directory (or "move" to a different directory in your file system).
To use it, type `cd` followed by an argument, which is the path of the folder you want to navigate to.
The path can be either *absolute* or *relative*.

For example, if you are on macOS and your current working directory is your home directory (for example, `/Users/user`), you can switch to the `/Downloads` folder by using either an absolute or relative path with the `cd` command:

```{zsh filename="Absolute path (Output)"}
#| code-copy: false
~$ cd /Users/user/Downloads
~/Downloads$ pwd
/Users/user/Downloads
```

```{zsh filename="Relative path (Output)"}
#| code-copy: false
~$ cd Downloads
~/Downloads$ pwd
/Users/user/Downloads
```

You may notice that the prompt has been updated to show the new working directory.
If a path starts with a forward slash (`/`), it is considered an *absolute* path.
Paths that do not start with a forward slash are considered *relative* to the current working directory.

::: {.callout-tip title="Is Bash case sensitive?" collapse="true"}

Yes, in general Bash is case sensitive.
This means that it distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters in commands and filenames.
For example, if you created a file like `banana.txt` and then listed files that start with the letter `B`, the command line would tell you that there is `No such file or directory`.
If you then listed files that start with the letter `b`, the command line would find the file.

```{zsh filename="Code"}
touch banana.txt
```

```{zsh filename="Code"}
ls B*
```
  
```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
ls: B* No such file or directory
```

```{zsh filename="Code"}
ls b*
```
  
```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
banana.txt
```

Note that this case sensitivity might not apply to paths on your computer.
For example, `cd ~/Desktop` and `cd ~/desktop` might both lead macOS users to their `Desktop` directory.
Generally, if you're experiencing different behavior, it's possible that you're using a file system or environment where case sensitivity is not enforced, or there may be other factors at play.
Some file systems, such as those commonly used in macOS, are case-insensitive by default, while others, like those used in most Linux distributions, are case-sensitive.
Additionally, some configurations or filesystem options can affect this behavior.

:::

### Paths with spaces

If a path contains a space, it needs to be enclosed in quotation marks to be recognized by the command line.
Here is an example of a path with a space:

```{zsh filename="Output"}
/Users/User/Downloads/Directory with space/
```

If you attempt to use this path in a command without quotation marks, the command interpreter would understand it as three separate arguments since in command-line interfaces, spaces are typically used to separate different arguments or parameters.
Navigating to this absolute path with spaces would look like this:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
cd '/Users/User/Downloads/Directory with space/'
```

While the command line can handle paths (or files) with spaces in this way, we **recommend to avoid spaces** in folder and file names altogether, especially if you use the command line frequently.
For example, change the name of a directory called `my folder` to `my_folder`, using an underscore instead of a space.

### Taking shortcuts

#### Tilde: `~`

The tilde symbol (`~`) provides a convenient and abbreviated way to refer to the user's home directory, allowing us to easily construct paths relative to that directory.
To quickly change the current working directory to your user's home directory anywhere on your file system, we can use `cd ~` which will transport us back to the user's home directory.

```{zsh filename="Code"}
cd ~
```

For example:

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
~/Downloads$ cd ~
~$ 
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Finding the tilde (`~`) on your keyboard"}
::: {.panel-tabset}

#### {{< fa brands apple >}} Apple

On an Apple computer you can type the tilde (`~`) symbol by pressing the {{< kbd option >}} (`option`) key and the {{< kbd N >}} key simultaneously, then pressing {{< kbd Space >}}.

#### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows (German keyboard)
On a Windows PC with a German keyboard layout, you can type the tilde (`~`) by holding the {{< kbd AltGr >}} key and pressing the {{< kbd + >}} key.

:::
:::

#### Dot: `.`

Another symbol with a special meaning in paths, aside from `~`, is the dot (`.`).
It serves as a shorthand representation for the current working directory, and using it in a path means the reference remains within the same directory.

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
~$ cd .
~$
```

In turn, these two commands are equivalent:

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
~$ cd ./Downloads
```

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
~$ cd Downloads
```

#### Dot Dot: `..`

The `..` symbol is a shorthand representation for the parent directory of the current working directory (for a reminder about "parent" and "child" directories, see @tip-parent-child-directories).
It can be used repeatedly, allowing `cd ..` to move up one folder and `cd ../..` to move up two folders.
This is useful for creating relative paths to other branches within a directory tree.

For instance, by executing the following sequence of commands, we will navigate horizontally (or sideways) to a folder located at the same hierarchical level as the current working directory:

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
~$ cd ~ # <1>
~$ cd Downloads # <2>
~/Downloads$ cd ../Documents # <3>
~/Documents$ pwd # <4>
/Users/user/Documents
```
1. Move to the user's home directory using the `~` shorthand.
1. Move to the `Downloads` folder.
1. Move sideways to the `Documents` folder.
1. Display the current working directory using `pwd`.

## Clean and efficient command line

In this section, we provide some tips and tricks to help you become more efficient when using the command line and execute commands cleanly.

### Autocompletion

While using the command line, instead of typing out the full command or path, you can press the {{< kbd ⇥ >}} (`Tab`) key to automatically complete the rest of the command.
Begin typing a command or the initial letters of a file or directory, for example:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
cd ~/Doc
```

Once you've typed a portion of the command or path, press the {{< kbd ⇥ >}} key.
The command-line interface will attempt to auto-complete the command or path based on what matches your input.
In this example, it will :

```{zsh filename="Code"}
$ cd ~/Documents
```

If there are multiple possibilities, pressing {{< kbd ⇥ Tab >}} again will cycle through the available options, for example:

```{markdown filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
$ cd ~/Do
Documents/  Downloads/
```

Auto-completion also works for system commands. 
For example, typing `ls` (you will find out more about this command [below](#list-files-and-folders)) and pressing {{< kbd ⇥ Tab >}} might complete it to `ls -l` or `ls -a`.
Auto-completion also works for the Git commands that will be introduced in the following chapters of this book.
You can also cycle *backwards* through autocompleted options by holding {{< kbd Shift >}} (`Shift`), then pressing {{< kbd ⇥ Tab >}}.

### Command history

Using the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys on your keyboard allows you to quickly access and reuse commands without retyping them.

After executing one or multiple commands, pressing the `Up` arrow key retrieves the most recent command.
If you've navigated back using the `Up` arrow, pressing the `Down` arrow key moves you forward through the command history.
You can continue to press `Up` and `Down` to cycle through the executed commands.
To execute a command, hit {{< kbd Enter >}}, or you can edit it as needed before execution.

The main benefit of this is time efficiency. 
Instead of typing out the entire command, especially for lengthy or complex commands, you can retrieve and modify previous commands quickly.
It also minimizes the chances of introducing typos or syntax errors when reusing commands.
And it's also [the reason](https://www.commitstrip.com/en/2017/02/28/definitely-not-lazy/?) why the `Up` arrow key is among the earliest that needs replacement on software developers' keyboards.

### Clearing the command line

The `clear` command is used to clear the content of your terminal, providing a clean and empty slate. 
It helps improve visibility by removing previous commands, outputs, and clutter from your terminal window.

To clear the content of the terminal screen, type and execute the `clear` command:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
clear
```

Press {{< kbd Enter >}} and the terminal screen will be cleared, leaving only a new prompt at the top of the window.

### Saving command line history

When you exit the command line, your command history is not automatically saved by default. 
To review the commands you've used, you can use the `history` command, which works on both macOS and Windows (when using Git Bash).

If you're interested in keeping your command history for documentation or learning purposes, you can easily save either your current session's history or the entire history stored by your terminal to a text file using the following command: 

```{zsh filename="Code"}
history > history.txt
```

This command will capture your entire command history and save it to a file named `history.txt` in your current directory.
You can then view this file directly from the command line or through your usual file viewer.

### Aborting commands

Do you want to abort a command?
You can usually abort commands by simultaneously typing:

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> (`Control` + `C`)

This sends an interrupt signal (`SIGINT`) to the process, which usually terminates it.

## Listing files and folders

The `ls` command is used to list the files and folders in a specified directory or the current working directory.
If you run this command, you will see the contents of your current working directory.

```{zsh filename="Code"}
ls
```

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of the `ls` command executed in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash filename="Output"}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: markdown
#| code-copy: false
ls
```
</details>

However, the `ls` command provides various options, such as flags and arguments, to extend its functionality beyond simple file listing.
To provide additional instructions to a command, we can pass flags and arguments by typing them after the command name.

### Listing files in a specific directory

To list files in a specific folder (*relative* to the current working directory), we use the `ls` command followed by the name of the folder.
For example, we can list the contents of the `chapters` folder in the project directory of this guide.
In this case, `chapters` is a so-called "argument" to the `ls` command.

```{zsh filename="Code"}
ls chapters
```

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of this command executed in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash filename="Output"}

### Listing hidden files

Hidden files, often starting with a dot (`.`) in their names, are files that remain mostly hidden from the regular view in GUIs.
They can serve different purposes, such as storing configuration settings, sensitive data, or temporary files.
Hidden files can be accessed through the command line or by changing settings in the file manager to make them visible.

To view hidden files, we can use the `-a` (for "all") flag in the `ls` command:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
ls -a
```

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of `ls -a` executed in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash filename="Output"}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: markdown
#| code-copy: false
ls -a
```
</details>

::: {#tip-only-hidden .callout-tip title="How can I list *only* hidden files?" collapse="true"}

To list *only* hidden files, you can run the following command:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
ls -d .?*
```

The `-d` (or `--directory`) flag lists directory entries instead of contents and does not dereference symbolic links.
The `.?*` argument will only state hidden files.

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of `ls -d .?*` executed in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash filename="Output"}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: markdown
#| code-copy: false
ls -d .?*
```
</details>

:::

::: {.callout-note title="What do `.` and `..` mean in the output of `ls -a`?" collapse="true"}

In the output of `ls -a`, you will see both `.` and `..` listed, alongside other files in your directory:

```{markdown filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
.
..
```

As introduce above, `.` (single dot) represents the current directory while `..` (double dot) represents the parent directory.
For example, if you are in `/Users/user/Documents`, `.` refers to `/Users/user/Documents` and `..` refers to `/Users/user`.

These entries are always present in every directory, which is why they show up when you use `ls -a` to display all files.
They aren't actual files or directories you can see normally, but rather are system references that help with navigation.

:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Be cautious when modifying hidden files!"}
It's important to **be cautious when modifying or deleting hidden files**, as they can impact the proper functioning of the operating system and applications.
This is also typically the reason why these files are hidden.
Only listing hidden files (as explained in this section) does not modify them, so it's generally safe to execute the `ls -a` command to view hidden files.
:::

### Flags and arguments

Command-line commands can be extended using so-called flags and arguments.
The difference between a flag and an argument is that a **flag is used to modify the behavior** of a command, while an **argument provides additional input** or information to the command.

#### What is a flag?

A flag is typically a single character or a combination of characters preceded by a hyphen (`-`) or double hyphen (`--`).
It is used to enable or disable specific options or features of a command.
Flags are optional and are used to customize the behavior of the command.
An example for a flag is the `-a` flag in the `ls -a` command that is used to list all files in a folder.

```{zsh filename="Code"}
ls -a
```

#### What is an argument?

An argument is the actual input or information that is passed to a command to perform a specific action.
It can be a value, a file name, a directory path, or any other data required by the command to complete its task.
Arguments are often positioned after the command and any flags, and they can be mandatory or optional depending on the command's requirements.
An example for an argument is the path that is provided with the `cd` command to navigate to it.

```{zsh filename="Code"}
ls ~/Desktop
```

#### Multiple single-letter flags

You can combine multiple single-letter flags by using a single dash.
For example, to instruct the `ls` command to list *all* files (including hidden files) in a *long* format that is easy to read for *humans*, you can use the following combination of flags:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
ls -alh
```

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of `ls -alh` executed in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash filename="Output"}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: bash
#| code-copy: false
ls -alh
```
</details>

#### Getting help

Getting help with commands can differ between operating systems.
See the instructions for Windows and macOS below.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### {{< fa brands microsoft >}} Windows

If you want to know what flags and arguments a command supports, most commands provide usage information when you use the flag `--help`.
For example, you can use the `ls` command together with the `--help` flag:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
ls --help
```

This will list all possible flags you can use together with the `ls` command.

#### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

On macOS you can't use the `--help` flag.
Instead you can use the `man` command, in combination with your desired command.
This will display the manual page for a specified command. 
You can navigate through the manual pages using the arrow keys, and you can exit by pressing `q`. 
For example:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
man ls
```

:::

## Manipulating the file system

The command line offers various commands for creating, moving, and deleting folders and files.

### Creating a folder

Let's use the command line to create a new project folder.
To make a new directory, we'll use the `mkdir` command.

::: {.callout-warning title="Be aware *where* you are creating new directories!"}
When creating new directories, consider their location carefully. 
If you are experimenting, consider deleting the newly created directories afterwards to avoid clutter.
:::

The path of the directory we want to create is given as an argument to the command.
If we want to create a directory in the current folder, we just need to use its name, as the path is assumed to be relative.
For example, to create a new folder for your favorite recipes or a city guide, we can use the following command:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## {{< fa utensils >}} Recipes
```{zsh filename="Code"}
mkdir recipes
```
## {{< fa tree-city >}} City Guide
```{zsh filename="Code"}
mkdir city-guide
```
:::

Make sure that the new folder is present by using the `ls` command, and then move into it by using the `cd` command.

::: {.panel-tabset}
## {{< fa utensils >}} Recipes
```{zsh filename="Code"}
cd recipes
```
## {{< fa tree-city >}} City Guide
```{zsh filename="Code"}
cd city-guide
```
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Error `File exists`" collapse="false"}

By default, you can't overwrite existing directories and will receive a warning when run `mkdir` already exists.
Try repeating the previous `mkdir` command.
You will receive an error like this: 

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
mkdir: recipes: File exists
```
:::

### Creating multiple folders

Next, we will proceed to create multiple additional folders within the project folder.
The `mkdir` command allows us to create multiple directories simultaneously by providing multiple arguments, each representing a separate folder.
For example, we might create the following three folders:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## {{< fa utensils >}} Recipes
```{zsh filename="Code"}
mkdir vegetarian vegan glutenfree
```
## {{< fa tree-city >}} City Guide
```{zsh filename="Code"}
mkdir food nature museum
```
:::

### Creating files

Let's create some files in the project folder.
To do this, you can use your favorite text editor or the command line.
In the command line, you can use the `touch` command to create a new empty file.
The file doesn't need to contain anything.
For example, to create an empty file, we can use the following command:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## {{< fa utensils >}} Recipes
```{zsh filename="Code"}
touch recipes.txt
```
## {{< fa tree-city >}} City Guide
```{zsh filename="Code"}
touch city-guide.txt
```
:::

### Opening files

To open files, you can use your preferred text editor but also the command line. 
On the command line, you can use the `start` command on Windows (using Git Bash) or the `open` command on macOS.
These commands will open the specified file in the default application associated with the file type.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### {{< fa brands microsoft >}} Windows (Git Bash)

::: {.panel-tabset}
## {{< fa utensils >}} Recipes
```{zsh filename="Code"}
start recipes.txt
```
## {{< fa tree-city >}} City Guide
```{zsh filename="Code"}
start city-guide.txt
```
:::

#### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

::: {.panel-tabset}
## {{< fa utensils >}} Recipes
```{zsh filename="Code"}
open recipes.txt
```
## {{< fa tree-city >}} City Guide
```{zsh filename="Code"}
open city-guide.txt
```
:::

:::

### Outputting text

The `echo` command is a simple and versatile command used to display text or output it to files. 
It is commonly used in shell scripts and command-line operations to print messages, display variable values, or generate simple text files.

#### Basic use of `echo`

The `echo` command outputs the text that follows it. 
For example, `echo "Hello, World!"` will display `Hello, World!` in the terminal.

```{zsh filename="Code"}
echo "Hello World"
```

```{markdown filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
Hello World
```

{{< include ../faq/_quotation-marks.qmd >}}

#### Using variables with `echo`

You can use `echo` to display the values of variables.
For instance, `echo $HOME` will print the path of the home directory.

```{zsh filename="Code"}
echo $HOME
```

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of `echo $HOME` executed in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash filename="Output"}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: bash
#| code-copy: false
echo $HOME
```
</details>

#### Using special characters with `echo`

To include special characters or commands in the text output, use quotes around the text. 
For example, the following command will display the current date:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
echo "Current date: $(date)"
```

```{bash filename="Output"}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: zsh
#| code-copy: false
echo "Current date: $(date)"
```

#### Writing short text into files

The `echo` command can also be used to write text to a file directly from the command line. 
By combining echo with the `>>` operator, you can add content to an existing file.
For example, to add text to the text file using the command line run the following command:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## {{< fa utensils >}} Recipes
```{zsh filename="Code"}
echo "This is a list of all my favorite recipes." >> recipes.txt 
```
## {{< fa tree-city >}} City Guide
```{zsh filename="Code"}
echo "This is a list of all my favorite places." >> city-guide.txt
```
:::

This adds the provided text *to the existing content* of the text file.

::: {.callout-warning collapse="false" title="Difference between using `>>` or `>` with `echo` when writing short text into files"}

When you use the command `echo "Git is cool" >> file.txt`, it will **append the text** "Git is cool" to the end of the file `file.txt`.
If the file does not exist, it will be created and the text "Git is cool" will be added.
If the file already contains other text, the "Git is cool" text will be added after the existing text at the end of the file.

On the other hand, when you use the command `echo "Git is cool" > file.txt`, it will write the text "Git is cool" to a file named `file.txt`.
**If the file already exists, it will overwrite its contents** with the new text "Git is cool".

:::

### Viewing file content

If you want to quickly view the content of a file without opening it, you can do so in the command line using the `cat` command.
To display the content of a file, simply use `cat` followed by the file name. 
For example:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## {{< fa utensils >}} Recipes
```{zsh filename="Code"}
cat recipes.txt
```
## {{< fa tree-city >}} City Guide
```{zsh filename="Code"}
cat city-guide.txt
```
:::

This command will output the entire content of the text file to the terminal.

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of the `cat` command applied to the `.gitignore` file in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash filename="Output"}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: markdown
#| code-copy: false
cat .gitignore
```
</details>

### Moving folders and files

Let's say we want to move the text file to another subfolder.
We can use the `mv` command to move files and folders.
The `mv` command requires two arguments: the first is the files or folders to be moved, and the second is the path where they should be moved.
To move the text file to the subfolder, the command would look like this:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## {{< fa utensils >}} Recipes
```{zsh filename="Code"}
mv recipes.txt vegan
```
## {{< fa tree-city >}} City Guide
```{zsh filename="Code"}
mv city-guide.txt food
```
:::

### Renaming files and folders

Suppose we don't like the subfolders names because the text file actually contains content is more relevant for another subfolder.
We can use the `mv` command to rename files and folders by moving them to a different location in the file system like this:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## {{< fa utensils >}} Recipes
```{zsh filename="Code"}
mv vegan meat
```
## {{< fa tree-city >}} City Guide
```{zsh filename="Code"}
mv food attractions
```
:::

::: {.callout-note title="You can't be *inside* a folder when renaming it." collapse="true"}

Note that you can't be *inside* a folder when renaming it (your current working directory is the folder that you want to rename) but you have to be in its parent directory.
Let's say that you try to rename the subfolder but you are *inside* the folder (check with `pwd`), you will receive an error like this:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## {{< fa utensils >}} Recipes
```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
vegan$ mv vegan meat
mv: rename vegan to meat: No such file or directory
```
## {{< fa tree-city >}} City Guide
```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
vegan$ mv food attractions
mv: rename food to attractions: No such file or directory
```
:::

:::

#### Moving files to the parent directory

Let's assume that you moved the text file to the subfolder, as shown above.
Now let's move the text file back to the parent folder.
To do this, you can first `cd` into the subfolder and then use the `..` shortcut (for details on `..`, see the [section above](#dot-dot-..)) in combination with the `mv` command:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## {{< fa utensils >}} Recipes
```{zsh filename="Code"}
cd vegan
mv recipes.txt ..
```
## {{< fa tree-city >}} City Guide
```{zsh filename="Code"}
cd vegan
mv city-guide.txt ..
```
:::

### Downloading files

There are various ways how you can download files from the internet using the command line.
Here, we present two simple approaches using the tools `curl` and `wget`.
Note, that `wget` is not natively installed on Windows.
They are both powerful tools used to download files from the web directly through the command line.
This is particularly useful for retrieving files from a remote server or downloading large datasets.

To download a file into your current directory, simply use the following syntax:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## `curl`
```{zsh filename="Code"}
curl -O <URL> # <1>
```
1. Replace `URL` with the URL of the files(s) that you want to download.

## `wget`
```{zsh filename="Code"}
wget <URL> # <1>
```
1. Replace `URL` with the URL of the files(s) that you want to download.
:::

For example, if you want to download the logo of this project, you could use the following command:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## `curl`
```{zsh filename="Code"}
curl -O https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/static/logo.svg
```

## `wget`
```{zsh filename="Code"}
wget https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/static/logo.svg
```
:::

This command will download `logo.svg` from the specified URL and save it in the current working directory.

### Wildcards

Now let's learn how to use so-called wildcards to perform actions on multiple files or folders at the same time.
A wildcard is denoted by the symbol `*`, and it helps us **select file system arguments that match certain patterns**.
For example, suppose we wish to display a list of all files of a certain file type (here, all files with the `.yml` file extension) in the current directory:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
ls -alh *.yml
```

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of the `ls -alh *.yml` command executed in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash filename="Output"}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: markdown
#| code-copy: false
ls -alh *.yml
```

::: {.callout-tip title="What does this output mean?" collapse="true"}
The first column (`-rw-r--r--`) represents the file permissions.
In Unix-like systems, it shows who can read, write, or execute the file.
In this case, the files are readable and writable by the owner (`rw-`), readable by the group (`r--`), and readable by others (`r--`).

The second column (`1`) indicates the number of hard links to the file.

The third column (`runner`) is the username of the file's owner.
Here, the username is `runner` because the this online guide is build automatically on GitHub using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and `runner` refers to the computing environment where the build process is executed.
If you would build the book on your computer, it would show your username. 

The fourth column (`docker`) is the group associated with the file.
Here, the group name is `docker` which again refers to the computing environment where this online guide is built.

The fifth column shows the size of the file. 
In this case there are just small textfiles included with the sizes ranging from `97B` to `3.0K`.

The next column (for example, `Jan 18 20:39`) display the date and time when the file was last modified.

The last column (for example, `_affiliations.yml` etc.) shows the name of each file.
:::
</details>

By using the wildcard `*`, we can generate a list of all files ending with `.yml`.
Similarly, we can apply the wildcard at the end of a path to match items starting with a specific letter, such as folders beginning with `i`:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
ls -alh i*
```

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of the command `ls -alh i*` executed in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash filename="Output"}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: markdown
#| code-copy: false
ls -alh i*
```
</details>

### Removing files and folders

To delete files and folders, you can use the `rm` command.
Provide the path of the files or folders that you want to delete as the argument.
However, if you want to remove a folder, you need to include the `-r` (or `--recursive`) flag.

::: {.callout-important title="Warning: Be careful when using the `rm` command!" collapse="false"}
When you use the `rm` command to delete files, they are **removed entirely (!!!)** from your system and cannot be retrieved from a "Recycle Bin" or "Trash" as when you delete files using the file browser!
:::

For example, to remove a specific folder, you would use the following command:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## {{< fa utensils >}} Recipes
```{zsh filename="Code"}
rm -r glutenfree
```
## {{< fa tree-city >}} City Guide
```{zsh filename="Code"}
rm -r museum
```
:::

### Combining commands 

Combining commands in the command-line using semicolons `;` is a way to execute multiple commands sequentially on a single line. 
Each command is separated by a semicolon, and they are executed one after the other, regardless of the success or failure of the previous command.

For example, let's say you want to (1) create a new directory, (2) move into that directory, and then (3) list the files in that directory, all in one go.
You can use semicolons to combine these commands like this:

```{zsh filename="Code"}
mkdir new_directory ; cd new_directory ; ls
```

This will (1) create a new directory called `new_directory`, (2) change the current working directory to `new_directory` and (3) list the files in this new directory. 

## Summary

In this lesson, we have achieved the following:

1. We clarified some of the technical terms associated with the command line.
1. We explored the components of command-line commands: paths, arguments, and flags.
1. We gained knowledge about relative and absolute paths, including convenient shortcuts like `~`, `.` and `..`.
1. We experienced the functionality of wildcards.
1. We acquired familiarity with several essential shell commands.

It's important to note that what we covered here only scratches the surface of what can be accomplished using the shell.
The primary aim was to provide useful concepts that help when learning Git.
