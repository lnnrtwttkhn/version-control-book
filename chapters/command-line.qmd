## Why using Git from the command line?

Git is fundamentally a command-line tool.
This is why comfort with the command line is essential for learning Git.

## General advantages of the command line

1. **Longevity:** The command line has stood the test of time, remaining relevant and widely used even as new technologies emerge.
1. **Power:** The command line is a robust and powerful tool, enabling users to accomplish intricate tasks efficiently.
1. **Simplicity:** With just a few keystrokes or lines of code, the command line empowers users to execute complex tasks effortlessly.
1. **Task Automation:** The shell allows users to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and effort in performing them manually.
1. **Workflow Integration:** Users can seamlessly combine smaller tasks into larger, more potent workflows, enhancing productivity and efficiency.
1. **Comprehensive Feature Set:** The command line interface provides access to the complete range of Git features, offering more extensive functionality compared to graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
1. **Extensive Online Support:** When seeking help or troubleshooting Git-related issues online, you will often find valuable assistance in the form of command line instructions.
Platforms like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/git) frequently provide guidance and solutions based on command line usage.

## Terminology

A **file** is an unit of digital data storage that can contain a variety of information, such as text, images or even programs. 
It is identified by an unique name and an extension, which indicates the file's format or type. 
Files are organized within a file system, allowing users to create, access, modify, and delete them.

A **folder** is a container used in file systems to store and organize files and other folders.
Folders provide a hierarchical structure that allows users to group and manage files, making it easier to locate and navigate through data.

A **directory** is the more technical term, while **folder** is a user-friendly term for the same concept. 
In practice, the two terms are often used interchangeably, and many operating systems have adopted the term "folder".

The **"command-line interface (CLI)"** is a text-based way to interact with computer programs.
Most people primarily use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to work with their programs, but historically, text-based interfaces were more common.
Often, the GUI can only access a limited set of features available through the CLI and some programs don't even have a GUI and can only be used through the command line.
For many years, the command line was the primary way to interact with computers.
Before GUIs like the ones we use today, early computer users communicated with their machines by typing text-based commands.
This text-based interaction allowed them to perform various tasks, from running programs to managing files and directories.

**"Terminal"** is short for "terminal emulator", which is a program that mimics a physical device called a terminal.
Terminals were used to connect to mainframe computers in the early days of computing.
The terminal program creates the window with the dark background, light text, and cursor.

A **"shell"** is a program that provides the command line to your operating system.
It allows you to perform various tasks that your operating system offers, such as managing files, running and stopping programs, and changing system settings, all through text commands.
When you "open a terminal", the program initially communicating with the terminal is a shell.
There are multiple shell options available for different operating systems, with the most popular one being the "Bourne Again Shell" or "Bash".

The terms "shell", "command line", "command-line interface (CLI)", and "terminal" are used interchangeably and generally refer to the same thing: a simple window with a dark background and light text, showing a prompt and a blinking cursor.
In movies, when people hack into computers, they often type rapidly in this window.

## Finding the command line

This section can you help you finding the command line on your system.
Click on the tab for your operating system for detailed information.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands apple >}} MacOS

You can access your default shell through the Terminal program located within the Utilities folder:
There are (at least) three different ways to get there:

- In the Finder, go to `Applications` > `Utilities` > `Terminal.app`
- In the Finder, select the `Go` menu > `Utilities` > `Terminal.app`
- Activate the Mac `Spotlight` search function, type `Terminal` in the search bar, and press the `Return` key.

You may want to keep Terminal in your [Dock](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-apps-from-the-dock-mh35859/mac) to find it more easily.

::: {.callout-tip title="Mac Terminal: Bash or Zsh?" collapse="true"}

On a Mac computer running macOS Mojave or earlier versions, the default Unix Shell is Bash.
Unix being a family of operating systems serving as the basis for Linux and macOS with the inclusion of a command line interface (or Unix Shell) as a key feature.
For a Mac computer operating on macOS Catalina or later releases, the default Unix Shell is Zsh.
Bash and Zsh are both programs, which are command-line interfaces for interacting with an operating system.
Zsh is often considered better than Bash for its more advanced features and improved scripting capabilities.
It also has extensive community-contributed plugins and themes.
However, the change to Zsh was not a drastic shift for most users, since there a few practical differences.

To verify if your machine is configured to use a shell other than Bash, you can type `echo $SHELL` in your Terminal window.
If the output is `/bin/bash` or a similar path, it means your default shell is set to Bash. 
This is the most common shell on Unix-based systems, including macOS.
If the output is `/bin/zsh` or a similar path, it means your default shell is set to Zsh.
If the output is a different path, it indicates that your shell is configured to use a different shell program.
If your machine is configured to use a shell other than Bash, you can switch to Bash by opening a terminal and typing `bash`.

### Which macOS version do I have installed?

1. In the upper-left corner of your screen, click on the {{< fa brands apple >}} logo.
1. Select "About This Mac":
A dropdown menu will appear.
Choose "About This Mac".
1. View macOS Version:
In the "About This Mac" window, you will see information about your Mac, including the macOS version. 
The version number will be listed under the "Overview" tab. 
For example, it might say "macOS Big Sur" or "macOS Monterey", along with the version number (e.g., "Version 11.4").

## {{< fa brands microsoft >}} Windows

By default, Windows operating systems do not come with a pre-installed Unix Shell program.
In this guide, we recommend using an emulator provided by [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), which grants you access to both Bash shell commands and Git.

For an installation guide, you can check out the chapter on [installation](installation.qmd) and [setup](setup.qmd).
Once you have installed Git for Windows, you can easily open a terminal by launching the program called Git Bash from the Windows start menu.

## {{< fa brands linux >}} Linux

Open a fresh Terminal.

## {{< fa rocket >}} JupyterHub

If it is not possible for you to access a command line interface using your personal computer, you can use a remote solution with [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub).
JupyterHub is a web-based platform that allows multiple users to access an interactive computing environment on a shared server.

You can access a remote environment, using your Universit√§t Hamburg login credentials [here](https://code.min.uni-hamburg.de).
Simply click on the link and log in.

Once you are logged in, you should be able to view the remote environment and create files using different programs like {{< fa brands r-project >}}, Python {{< fa brands python >}} or Java {{< fa brands java >}}.

![Screenshot of JupyterHub, showing the start screen.](../static/cli_jupyter.png){#fig-jupyter}

If you scroll down in the "launcher" window, there should be the option to open a terminal window.
Your remote environment will be mostly empty, but you can move around and manage files just like you could on your own computer.

![Screenshot of JupyterHub, showing the terminal.](../static/cli_jupyter_2.png){#fig-jupyter_2}

:::

## Opening the command line

When you open the shell, you'll see a prompt that tells you the shell is ready for input.
Your terminal interface will usually show a message similar to the following prompt:

```{bash}
$
```

In the shell, the prompt is usually represented by the symbol `$` but it can be different sometimes.
In our examples, we'll use `$` as the prompt.
The important thing to remember is **to not type the prompt, `$`, itself when entering commands**.
Only type the command that comes after the `$` prompt.
For this reason, we remove the `$` prompt from all code examples in this guide.
Also, remember to press the `Enter` key after typing a command to execute it.

After the prompt, you'll see a text cursor that shows where you can type.
The cursor can be a flashing or solid block, or it can be an underscore or a pipe symbol.
You may have seen a similar cursor in a text editing program.

Keep in mind that your prompt may look slightly different.
Usually, in popular shell environments, your username and the host name appear before the `$` symbol.
For example, your prompt might look like this:

```{bash}
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~$
```

## Navigating the file system

### Introduction

You might be familiar with using your mouse to click through folders in your file browser, or perhaps you use arrow keys and clicks in the Finder (on macOS) or File Explorer (on Windows) to manage your files.

The command line offers a different, one could say less intuitive, but very efficient and precise way to interact with your computer's file system.
Instead of relying on a graphical user interface, you use text-based commands to perform tasks like exploring the contents of folders, creating and deleting files, and moving between folders. 

### Directory and file structure

In a file system, directories (or folders) and files are organized hierarchically to enable the storage and retrieval of data.
Each level in the hierarchy is called a "level" or "depth".
In the context of file systems, the hierarchy of directories is often described as a parent-child relationship and folders are therefore often referred to as "parent directories" and "child directories" (for details, see the box below).

The **root directory** is the highest level in the hierarchy.
On Unix-based systems (including macOS), the root directory is denoted by `/`.
On Windows, it is typically denoted by a drive letter followed by `\` (e.g., `C:\`).
While the fundamental concepts of directories and files are consistent across operating systems, there are some differences in folder structures between macOS (Unix-based) and Windows:

::: {.callout-tip title='What are "parent" and "child" directories?' collapse="true"}
In the context of file systems, a "parent directory" and a "child directory" describe the relationship between directories (or folders).

- **Parent Directory:** This is the directory that is "higher up" in the directory hierarchy and contains one or more "child directories."
- **Child Directory:** A child directory is located "inside" or "below" a parent directory.
It is contained within the parent directory and is considered subordinate to it, much like a child in a family is part of the larger family unit.

```{bash}
parent $ tree
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ child1
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ child2

3 directories
```

:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### {{< fa brands microsoft >}} Windows

Each drive (e.g., `C:`, `D:`) has its own root directory, and it is denoted by the drive letter followed by `\` (e.g., `C:\`).
Windows uses `\` as the directory separator.
The home directory is often `C:\Users\username\`.
An example path on Windows might be:

```{bash}
C:\Users\username\Documents\file.txt` 
```

#### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

On macOS the root directory is denoted by `/`, which is also used as the directory separator.
The home directory for a user is typically `/Users/username/`.
An example path on Mac OS could be:

```{bash}
/Users/username/Documents/file.txt
```

:::

### Current working directory

The current **working directory** is the location within your file system where a user or an application is presently performing file operations or running commands.
The command `pwd` (short for "print working directory") will display the current directory that the shell is currently focused on in your file system.

```{bash}
pwd
```

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of this command executed in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: bash
pwd
```
</details>

### Command not found

If the shell cannot find the program you typed as a command, it will show an error message.
This can happen if you made a mistake when typing the command or if the program for that command is not installed on your system.
For example, if you made a mistake when typing the `pwd` command, and accidentally entered `pws`, the following error message might appear:

```{bash}
pws: command not found
```

### Moving between folders

The `cd` command is used to change the current working directory (or "move" to a different directory in your file system).
To use it, type `cd` followed by an argument, which is the path of the folder you want to navigate to.
The path can be either *absolute* or *relative*.

For example, if you are on macOS and your current working directory is your home directory (for example, `/Users/wittkuhn`), you can switch to the `/Downloads` folder by using either an absolute or relative path with the `cd` command:

```{bash, filename="Absolute path"}
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~$ cd /Users/wittkuhn/Downloads
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~/Downloads$ pwd
/Users/wittkuhn/Downloads
```

```{bash, filename="Relative path"}
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~$ cd Downloads
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~/Downloads$ pwd
/Users/wittkuhn/Downloads
```

You may notice that the prompt has been updated to show the new working directory.
If a path starts with a forward slash (`/`), it is considered an *absolute* path.
Paths that do not start with a forward slash are considered *relative* to the current working directory.

Note, that if a path contains a space, it needs to be enclosed in quotes to be recognized by the command line.
Here is an example of a path with a space:

```{bash}
/Users/User/Downloads/Directory with Space/
```

If you attempt to use this path in a command without quotes, the command interpreter would understand it as three separate arguments since in command-line interfaces, spaces are typically used to separate different arguments or parameters.
Navigating to this absolute path with spaces would look like this:

```{bash}
cd '/Users/User/Downloads/Directory with Space/'
```

While the command line can handle paths (or files) with spaces in this way, we **recommend to avoid spaces** in folder and file names altogether, especially if you use the command line frequently.

### Taking shortcuts

#### Tilde: `~`

The tilde symbol (`~`) provides a convenient and abbreviated way to refer to the user's home directory, enabling us to easily construct paths relative to that directory.
To quickly change the current working directory to your user's home directory anywhere on your file system, we can use `cd ~` which will transport us back to the user's home directory.

```{bash}
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~/Downloads$ cd ~
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~$ 
```

#### Dot: `.`

Another symbol with a special meaning in paths, aside from `~`, is the dot (`.`).
It serves as a shorthand representation for the current working directory, and using it in a path means the reference remains within the same directory.

```{bash}
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~$ cd .
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~$
```

In turn, these two commands are equivalent:

```{bash}
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~$ cd ./Downloads
```

```{bash}
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~$ cd Downloads
```

#### Dot Dot: `..`

The `..` symbol is a shorthand representation for the parent directory of the current working directory.
It can be used repeatedly, allowing `cd ..` to move up one folder and ``cd ../..` to move up two folders.
This is useful for creating relative paths to other branches within a directory tree.

For instance, by executing the following sequence of commands, we will navigate horizontally (or sideways) to a folder located at the same hierarchical level as the current working directory:


```{bash}
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~$ cd ~ # <1>
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~$ cd Downloads # <2>
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~/Downloads$ cd ../Documents # <3>
wittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~/Documents$ pwd # <4>
/Users/wittkuhn/Documents
```
1. Move to the user's home directory using the `~` shorthand.
1. Move to the `Downloads` folder.
1. Move sideways to the `Documents` folder.
1. Display the current working directory.

::: {.callout-tip title="Using Command History Navigation" collapse="true"}
You can access your command history by using the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to cycle through your last used commands.
To execute a command, hit Enter, or you can edit it as needed before execution.
This makes it easier to find and reuse specific commands.
And is also [the reason](https://www.commitstrip.com/en/2017/02/28/definitely-not-lazy/?) why the up arrow key is among the earliest that needs replacement on software developers' keyboards.
:::

### Autocompletion

While using the command line, instead of typing out the full command or path, you can press the <kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd> key to automatically complete the rest.
Begin typing a command or the initial letters of a file or directory, for example:

```{bash}
cd ~/Doc
```

Once you've typed a portion of the command or path, press the <kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd> key.
The command-line interface will attempt to autocomplete the command or path based on what matches your input.
In this case for example:

```{bash}
cd ~/Documents/
```

If there are multiple possibilities, pressing <kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd> again will cycle through the available options.
Autocompletion also works for system commands. 
For example, typing `ls` and pressing <kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd> might complete it to `ls -l` or `ls -a`.
Autocompletion also works for the Git commands, that will be introduced in the following chapters of this book.

### Command history

Using the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys on your keyboard allows you to quickly access and reuse commands without retyping them.

After executing one or multiple commands, pressing the `Up` arrow key retrieves the most recent command.
If you've navigated back using the `Up` arrow, pressing the `Down` arrow key moves you forward through the command history.
You can continue to press `Up` and `Down` to cycle through the executed commands.

The primary benefit of this is time efficiency. 
Instead of typing out the entire command, especially for lengthy or complex commands, you can retrieve and modify previous commands quickly.
It also minimizes the chances of introducing typos or syntax errors when reusing commands.

### Clearing the command line

The `clear` command is used to clear the content of your terminal, providing a clean and empty slate. 
It helps improve visibility by removing previous commands, outputs, and clutter from your terminal window.

To clear the content of the terminal screen, simply type and execute the `clear` command:

```{bash}
clear
```

Press `Enter` and the terminal screen will be cleared, leaving only a new prompt at the top of the window.
After using `clear`, you can continue working in a fresh and uncluttered terminal environment.

## List files and folders

The `ls` command is used to list the files and folders in a specified directory or the current working directory.
If you run this command, you will see the contents of your current working directory.

```{bash}
ls
```

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of this command executed in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: bash
ls
```
</details>

However, the `ls` command provides various options, such as flags and arguments, to enhance its functionality beyond simple file listing.
To provide additional instructions to a command, we can pass flags and arguments by typing them after the command name.

### List files in a specific directory

For example, we can list the contents of the `/chapters` folder in the project directory of this guide:

```{bash}
ls chapters
```

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of this command executed in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: bash
ls chapters
```
</details>

In this case, `chapters` is an argument to the `ls` command.

### Listing hidden files

Hidden files, often starting with a dot in their names, are files that remain mostly concealed from the regular view in GUIs.
They can serve different purposes, such as storing configuration settings, sensitive data, or temporary files.
Hidden files can be accessed through the command line or by changing settings in the file manager to make them visible.
It's important to be cautious when modifying or deleting hidden files, as they can impact the proper functioning of the operating system and applications.
This is also typically the reason for these files being hidden. 
To view hidden files, we can use the `-a` (for "all") flag in the `ls` command.
For example, we can list hidden files in the project directory:

```{bash}
ls -a
```

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of this command executed in the `/chapters` directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: bash
ls -a
```
</details>

### Interlude: What is the difference between a flag and an argument?

#### Overview

The difference between a flag and an argument is that a **flag is used to modify the behavior** of a command, while an **argument provides additional input** or information to the command.

#### What is a flag?

A flag is typically a single character or a combination of characters preceded by a hyphen (`-`) or double hyphen (`--`).
It is used to enable or disable specific options or features of a command.
Flags are optional and are used to customize the behavior of the command.

#### What is an argument?

An argument is the actual input or information that is passed to a command to perform a specific action.
It can be a value, a file name, a directory path, or any other data required by the command to complete its task.
Arguments are often positioned after the command and any flags, and they can be mandatory or optional depending on the command's requirements.

#### Multiple single-letter flags

You can combine multiple single-letter flags by using a single dash.
For example, to instruct the `ls` command to list *all* files (including hidden files) in a *long* format that is easy to read for *humans*, you can use the following combination of flags:

```{bash}
ls -alh
```

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of this command executed in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: bash
ls -alh
```
</details>

#### Getting help

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### {{< fa brands microsoft >}} Windows (GitBash)

If you want to know what flags and arguments a command supports, most commands provide usage information when you use the flag `--help`.
For example, you can use the `ls` command together with the `--help` flag:

```{bash}
ls --help
```

This will list all possible flags you can use together with the `ls` command.

#### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

On Mac OS you can not use the `--help` flag.
Instead you can use the `man` command, in combination with your desired command.
This will display the manual page for a specified command. 
You can navigate through the manual pages using the arrow keys, and you can exit by pressing `q`. 
For example:

```{bash}
man ls
```

:::

## Manipulating the file system

The command line offers commands for creating, moving, and deleting folders and files.

### Creating a folder

Let's use the command line to create a new project folder as an example:
To make a directory, we'll use the `mkdir` command.

**Note:** 
When creating new directories, consider their location carefully. 
Consider deleting the newly created directories afterwards to avoid clutter.

The path of the directory we want to create is given as an argument to the command.
If we want to create a directory in the current folder, we just need to use its name, as the path is assumed to be relative.

```{bash}
mkdir my-project
```

Make sure the project folder is present by using the `ls` command, and then move into it by using the `cd` command.

```{bash}
ls
cd my-project
```

### Creating multiple folders

Next, we will proceed to create multiple additional folders within the `my-project` project folder.
The `mkdir` command allows us to create multiple directories simultaneously by providing multiple arguments, each representing a separate folder.
For example, for a data analysis project we might create the following three folders:

```{bash}
mkdir data results scripts
```

### Creating files

Let's create some files in the `my-project` project folder.
To do this, you can use your favorite text editor or the command line.
In the command line, you can use the `touch` command to create a new empty file.
The file doesn't need to contain anything.
For example, to create an empty file called `file.txt`, we can use the following command:

```{bash}
touch file.txt
```

### Opening files

To open files, you can use your preferred text editor but also the command line. 
On the command line, you can use the `open` command on macOS or the `start` command on Windows using Gitbash. 

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### {{< fa brands microsoft >}} Windows (GitBash)

```{bash}
start file.txt
```


#### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

```{bash}
open file.txt
```

:::

These commands will open the specified file in the default application associated with the file type.

### Writing short text into files

The `echo` command can be used to write text to a file, directly from the command line.
Using `echo` in combination with `>>` adds content to an existing file. 
For example, to add text to the `file.txt` file:

```{bash}
echo "This is a project for demonstration purposes." >> file.txt 
```

This adds the provided text to the existing content of `file.txt`.

### Viewing file content

If you want to quickly view the content of a file without opening it, you can do so in the command line using the `cat` command.
To display the content of a file, simply use `cat` followed by the file name. 
For example:

```{bash}
cat file.txt 
```

This command will output the entire content of the `file.txt` file to the terminal.

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of the `cat` command applied to the `.gitignore` file in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: bash
cat .gitignore
```
</details>

### Moving folders and files

Let's say we want to move the `file.txt` file to the `/scripts` folder.
We can use the `mv` command to move files and folders.
The `mv` command requires two arguments: the first is the files or folders to be moved, and the second is the path where they should be moved.
To move the `file.txt` file, the command would look like this:

```{bash}
mv file.txt scripts
```

### Renaming files and folders

Suppose we don't like the folder name `scripts` because `file.txt` is actually a documentation file, not a script.
We can use the `mv` command to rename files and folders by moving them to a different location in the file system, for example `docs`, like this:

```{bash}
mv scripts docs
```

### Wildcards

Now, let's learn how to use wildcards to perform actions on multiple files or folders at the same time.
A wildcard is denoted by the symbol `*`, and it helps us select file system arguments that match certain patterns.
For example, suppose we wish to display a list of all files of a certain file type (here, all files with the `.yml` file extension) in the current directory:

```{bash}
ls -alh *.yml
```

<details>
<summary>{{< fa eye >}} Click here to see the output of this command executed in the project directory of this guide.</summary>
```{bash}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| class.output: bash
ls -alh *.yml
```

::: {.callout-tip title="What does this output mean?" collapse="true"}
The first column (`-rw-r--r--`) represents the file permissions.
In Unix-like systems, it shows who can read, write, or execute the file.
In this case, the files are readable and writable by the owner (`rw-`), readable by the group (`r--`), and readable by others (`r--`).

The second column (`1`) indicates the number of hard links to the file.

The third column (`runner`) is the username of the file's owner.
Here, the username is `runner` because the this online guide is build automatically on GitHub using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and `runner` refers to the computing environment where the build process is executed.
If you would build the book on your computer, it would show your username. 

The fourth column (`docker`) is the group associated with the file.
Here, the group name is `docker` which again refers to the computing environment where this online guide is built.

The fifth column shows the size of the file. 
In this case there are just small textfiles included with the sizes ranging from `97B` to `3.0K`.

The next column (for example, `Jan 18 20:39`) display the date and time when the file was last modified.

The last column (for example, `_affiliations.yml` etc.) shows the name of each file.
:::

By using the wildcard `*`, we can generate a list of all files ending with `.yml`.
Similarly, we can apply the wildcard at the end of a path to match items starting with a specific letter, such as folders beginning with `i`:

```{bash}
ls -alh i*
```

### Removing files and folders

To delete files and folders, you can use the `rm` command.
Provide the path of the files or folders that you want to delete as the argument.
However, if you want to remove a folder, you need to include the `-r` (or `--recursive`) flag.

For example, to remove the `docs` folder, you would use the following command:

```{bash}
rm -r docs
```

When you use the `rm` command to delete files, they are **removed entirely (!!!)** from your system and cannot be retrieved from a "Recycle Bin" or "Trash" as when you delete files using the file browser!

### Combining commands 

Combining commands in the command-line using semicolons `;` is a way to execute multiple commands sequentially on a single line. 
Each command is separated by a semicolon, and they are executed one after the other, regardless of the success or failure of the previous command.

For example, let's say you want to (1) create a new directory, (2) move into that directory, and then (3) list the files in that directory, all in one go.
You can use semicolons to combine these commands like this:

```{bash}
mkdir new_directory ; cd new_directory ; ls
```

This will (1) create a new directory called `new_directory`, (2) change the current working directory to `new_directory` and (3) list the files in this new directory. 

## Summary

In this lesson, we have achieved the following:

1. Clarified some of the technical terms associated with the command line.
1. Explored the components of command-line commands: paths, arguments, and flags.
1. Gained knowledge about relative and absolute paths, including convenient shortcuts like `~`, `.` and `..`.
1. Witnessed the functionality of wildcards.
1. Acquired familiarity with several essential shell commands.

It's important to note that what we covered here only scratches the surface of what can be accomplished using the shell.
The primary aim was to provide useful concepts that help when learning Git.
