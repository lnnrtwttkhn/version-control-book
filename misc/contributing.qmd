## RStudio Project {#sec-rstudio-project}

- {{< fa book >}} ["Using RStudio Projects"](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects)

We recommend working in RStudio and open the RStudio Project.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands r-project >}} RStudio

- Double-click on the project file `version-control-book.Rproj` within your computer's file system (for example, macOS Finder).

## {{< fa terminal >}} Terminal

In the Terminal, run:

```{bash}
open version-control-book.Rproj
```

This will open the RStudio Project in RStudio.

#| file: version-control-book.Rproj
#| code-line-numbers: true
```
</details>

## Quarto {#sec-quarto}

This book is made with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).


### Local development

#### Setup

1. Read the [Get Started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) chapter of the Quarto documentation, which includes details on installation.

#### Preparation

1. Read this guide on how to contribute.
2. Familiarize yourself with [Quarto Books](https://quarto.org/docs/books/).

#### Local preview

```{bash}
quarto preview
```

### Add a new chapter

1. Create a new Quarto document inside the `/chapters/` folder
2. Add the new chapter to `_quarto.yml`.
Don't forget to specify the full path (including `/chapters/`)

```{yaml, filename="_quarto.yml (excerpt)"}
chapters:
  - index.qmd
  - chapters/YOUR-NEW-CHAPTER.qmd # <1>
  - another-chapter.qmd
```
1. Replace `YOUR-NEW-CHAPTER` with a concise filename.

<details>

```{bash, filename="_quarto.yml"}
#| file: _quarto.yml
#| code-line-numbers: true
```
</details>


## Dependency Management {#sec-dependency-management}

We use [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for project-local {{< fa brands r-project >}} dependency management.
For details on `renv`, see the [renv documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

### Using `renv` for the first time

After you open the Rstudio Project, you will (hopefully) see a similar output in the RStudio console:

```{bash}
# Bootstrapping renv 0.17.3 --------------------------------------------------
* Downloading renv 0.17.3 ... OK (downloaded binary)
* Installing renv 0.17.3 ... Done!
* Successfully installed and loaded renv 0.17.3.
* Project '~/version-control-book' loaded. [renv 0.17.3]
* This project contains a lockfile, but none of the recorded packages are installed.
* Use `renv::restore()` to restore the project library.
```

This output tells you that (1) `renv` was automatically installed and loaded, (2) the `renv` environment for the project was loaded, and (3) that none of packages recorded in the `renv` lockfile are installed.

The `renv` lockfile captures the state of the package library of the project at some point in time.
It is defining the **version of `renv`** used when generating the lockfile, the **version of** {{< fa brands r-project >}} used in that project, the **R repositories that were active** when the lockfile was created and the **package records** defining each {{< fa brands r-project >}} package, their version, and their installation source.
For details on the anatomy of `renv.lock`, see [this section](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/lockfile.html) in the `renv` documentation.

<details>
<summary>Click here to view the full `renv.lock` file of this project.</summary>
```{json, filename="renv.lock"}
#| file: renv.lock
#| code-line-numbers: true
```
</details>

### Restoring `renv`

If `renv` is activated but it recognized that (not all of) the packages listed in the `renv.lock` file are installed, `renv` will suggest to restore the project library using `renv::restore()`:

```{bash}
* This project contains a lockfile, but none of the recorded packages are installed.
* Use `renv::restore()` to restore the project library.
```

```{r}
renv::restore()
```

This will generate a list of files that will be updated.

<details>
<summary>Click here to view an example output of the `renv::restore()` command.</summary>
```{bash}
The following package(s) will be updated:

# CRAN ===============================

```
</details>

If you want to proceed with the update, type `y` and hit enter.

### Adding / removing packages

Install packages:

```{r}
install.packages("PACKAGE_NAME") # <1>
renv::install("PACKAGE_NAME") # <2>
```
1. Replace `PACKAGE_NAME` with the actual name of the package that you want to install.
1. Replace `PACKAGE_NAME` with the actual name of the package that you want to install.

Remove packages:

```{r}
remove.packages("PACKAGE_NAME") # <1>
renv::remove("PACKAGE_NAME") # <2>
```
1. Replace `PACKAGE_NAME` with the actual name of the package that you want to remove.
1. Replace `PACKAGE_NAME` with the actual name of the package that you want to remove.

Call `renv::snapshot()` to save the new state of the project library to the `renv.lock`:

```{r}
renv::snapshot()
```

### Commit your changes

The `renv.lock` is checked into version control, so after you updated it, make a new commit:

```{bash}
git add renv.lock
git commit -m "add package PACKAGE_NAME to renv" # <1>
```
1. Replace `PACKAGE_NAME` with the actual name of the package that you installed.
Adapt the commit message as needed.


## References {#sec-references}

- {{< fa book >}} ["Citations & Footnotes"](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) in the Quarto documentation.
- {{< fa book >}} [HTML options for references](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html#references).

### Cite a reference

References are stored in `references.bib`.

<details>
<summary>Click here to view the full `references.bib` file of this project.</summary>
```{bib, filename="references.bib"}
#| file: references.bib
#| code-line-numbers: true
```
</details>

Use the citation handle of the `.bib`-entry that you want to cite.
For example use `@chacon2014` to cite @chacon2014.
For details, see the chapter on ["Citations & Footnotes"](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) in the Quarto documentation.
Add the specific references that you used to the bottom of the document.
If the reference consists of multiple chapters and pages, try to specify the exact chapter or page.

### Add a new reference

1. Open `references.qmd`
1. Switch to the `Visual` Quarto editor.
1. Move the cursor into any place in the document.
1. Click on `Insert` and select `@ Citation ...`
1. If the reference has a DOI:
  1. Select `From DOI`
  1. Paste the DOI
  1. Select `Insert`
1. This should add the new reference to `references.bib`.
1. Move the citation key to the correct place

### Add license information

We want to keep track of license information.
If you add a new reference, please add the license information manually.

1. Go to `references.bib` and find the reference.
1. Inside the `.bib`-entry for the reference add a new field called `note` that includes the license information.

```{bib}
@book{
  note = {License: CC BY-NC}
}
```

For example, this is the references for @chacon2014:

```{bib}
@book{chacon2014,
	title = {Pro Git},
	author = {Chacon, Scott and Straub, Ben},
	year = {2014},
	date = {2014},
	publisher = {Apress},
	doi = {10.1007/978-1-4842-0076-6},
	url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4842-0076-6},
	note = {License: CC BY-NC}
}
```

## Code {#sec-code}

- {{< fa book >}} ["HTML Code Blocks"](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html) in the Quarto documentation

### Add code snippets

Add code snippets to a Quarto document like this:

````
```{{bash}}
git status
```
````

::: {.callout-warning title="Disable code execution in all Quarto documents by default!"}

Place the following code in the YAML header of **each** Quarto document:

```{yaml}
engine: knitr
execute:
  eval: false
```

<details>
<summary>Example: Click here for the YAML header of the current document.</summary>
```{yaml, filename="misc/contributing.qmd", echo=c(1:6)}
#| file: misc/contributing.qmd
#| code-line-numbers: true
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Click here to learn more.</summary>
Quarto enables the inclusion of executable code blocks in Markdown.
This empowers users to create reproducible documents and reports, as the code needed for generating the output is embedded within the document and automatically executed during rendering.

However, in this guide, we usually only want to **display code but not execute it**!
We therefore need to disable code execution in the YAML header of each Quarto document.

The YAML header in a Quarto document is used to specify important metadata and settings for the document.
It is typically placed at the top of the document enclosed between three dashes (`---`) to separate it from the main content.
The YAML header provides instructions to the Quarto rendering engine on how to process and present the document.
</details>

:::

### Reference external code

You can reference external code.
For example, the following code block will:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
df <- data.frame(
  description = c(
    "reference the `_quarto.yml` file",
    "display the first five lines of code",
    "add code line numbers",
    "add a filename to the code block"
  ),
  code = c(
    "`#| file: _quarto.yml`",
    "`echo=c(1:5)`",
    "`#| code-line-numbers: true`",
    '`filename="_quarto.yml"`'
  )
)
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
knitr::kable(df, format = "markdown", row.names = TRUE,
             escape = FALSE)
```

````
```{{bash, filename="_quarto.yml", echo=c(1:5)}}
#| file: _quarto.yml
#| code-line-numbers: true
```
````

<details>
<summary>Click here for the output of this example.</summary>
```{bash, filename="_quarto.yml", echo=c(1:5)}
#| file: _quarto.yml
#| code-line-numbers: true
```
</details>

### Add code annotations

- {{< fa book >}} ["Code Annotation"](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/code-annotation.html) in the Quarto documentation

> Code blocks and executable code cells in Quarto can include line-based annotations.
> Line-based annotations provide a way to attach explanation to lines of code much like footnotes.

For example, this is a code annotation for the `git status` command:

````
```{{bash}}
git status # <1>
```
1. `git status` displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.
````

## Images {#sec-images}

### Background

Images are stored in a [NextCloud folder]({{< var links.nextcloud >}}).
They are downloaded into the `/static` folder using the command specified in the `Makefile`.

### Installation

You need to install the following packages:

1. [GNU Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)
1. [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands apple >}}

1. **Prerequisite:** Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```{bash}
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. After you installed Homebrew, install [GNU Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)

```{bash}
brew install wget
```

[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) should already be installed.
Try by entering the following command into the Terminal:

```{bash}
make --version
```

## {{< fa brands windows >}}

TBA

## {{< fa brands linux >}}

TBA

:::


### Retrieve images

After you installed all the required software, run this command:

```{bash}
make static
```

::: {.callout-tip title="What's a Makefile and what does it do?" collapse="true"}

```{bash, filename="Makefile"}
#| file: Makefile
#| code-line-numbers: true
```

:::

### Add a new image

1. Become a collaborator on the [UHH Cloud folder]({{< var links.nextcloud >}}).
1. Go to the [UHH Cloud folder]({{< var links.nextcloud >}}).
1. Place the new image inside the folder.
Please use `-` to separate word in the filename.
1. Reference the image in the Quarto document relative to the root of the project directory:

```{markdown}
![](static/NEW-IMAGE.png)
```

### Download images in pre-render command

It's also possible to include the `make static` as a project script in the `pre-render` script.
This would re-execute `make static` before every render.
For the moment, we disabled this option, but it can be enabled in `_quarto.yml`.

## Variables {#sec-variables}

- {{< fa book >}} ["Variables"](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/variables.html) in the Quarto documentation

Quarto offers a number of ways to **include dynamic variables within documents**.
Dynamic variables are useful for externalizing content that varies depending on context, or as an alternative to repeating a value in multiple places.

In this project, we use a project-level `_variables.yml` file to define variables.
Variables can be either simple values or can include arbitrary Markdown content.

```{bash, filename="_variables.yml (excerpt)", echo=c(2, 3)}
#| file: _variables.yml
#| code-line-numbers: true
```

<details>
<summary>Click here to view the full `_variables.yml` file of this project.</summary>
```{bash, filename="_variables.yml"}
#| file: _variables.yml
#| code-line-numbers: true
```
</details>

The `var` shortcode then allows to include references to those variables within any document in this project.
For example, to include the link to the Nextcloud folder that stores static contents (images etc.) as a variable in a document, use `{{{< var links.nextcloud >}}}`.

For more details on variables, read the chapter on [Variables](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/variables.html) in the Quarto documentation. 

## Fontawesome Icons {#sec-icons}

- {{< fa brands github >}} [Font Awesome Extension for Quarto](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome)
- {{< fa icons >}} [Free Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free)

We use the Font Awesome Extension for Quarto to include [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons.

> This extension provides support including free icons provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
> Icons can be used in both HTML (via [Font Awesome 6 Free](https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free)) and PDF (via the [fontawesome5 LaTeX package](https://ctan.org/pkg/fontawesome5?lang=en)).

This extension includes support for **only free Font Awesome icons**.

To embed an icon, use the `{{{< fa >}}}` shortcode.
For example, `{{{< fa thumbs-up >}}}` will result in {{< fa thumbs-up >}}.
For details, see the [project documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome).

## Style Guide

We have compiled a set of guidelines to keep a consistent style across all chapters of the book.

### Summary

1. [Write one sentence per line](#write-one-sentence-per-line)
1. [Use consistent language](#use-consistent-language)

### Write one sentence per line

Please write each sentence on a new line.
Having each sentence on a new line will make no difference to how the text is displayed, there will still be paragraphs, but it will mean that any pull requests will be easier to check; the changes will be on a single line instead of somewhere in a paragraph.
Consider the example below.

```markdown
Today you are you, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is youer than you. - Dr Seuss
```

A pull request on this correcting it to have a ‘.’ after Dr would show as a change to the whole paragraph.
Contrast this with the next example which will be displayed online in the exact same way, but would see a change to a single line.

```markdown
Today you are you, that is truer than true.
There is no one alive who is youer than you.
- Dr Seuss
```

### Use consistent language

We try to use consistent language: 

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
variables <- yaml::read_yaml(here::here("_variables.yml"))
dt_input <- data.table::rbindlist(variables$language, fill = TRUE)
dt_output <- dt_input
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
dt_print <- dt_output %>%
  knitr::kable(., format = "markdown")
dt_print
```
