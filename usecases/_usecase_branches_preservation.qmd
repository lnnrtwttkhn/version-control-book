### Use case: Extending an existing analysis while preserving previous work

In research, you often need to extend or modify a previous analysis, such as adding new data, refining methods, or testing alternative hypotheses.
By creating a branch, you can develop this new version without risking the integrity of the previous working version.
If necessary, you can easily switch back to the previous branch to reproduce or reference results.
