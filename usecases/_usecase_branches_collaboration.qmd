### Use case: Maintaining code stability while collaborating

A collaborator may request to review specific outputs, such as plots or results from a previous stage of the project.
If you are in the middle of implementing new features or conducting a different analysis, this can create a problem.
By using branches, you can keep the current experimental changes isolated.
This allows you to quickly switch to the previous branch to provide the requested results without disrupting your ongoing development.
