### Use case: Collaborative research projects

Research often involves collaboration among multiple researchers, labs, or institutions.
Using remote repositories on platforms like GitHub or GitLab allows all team members to access and contribute to a central codebase or dataset.
The setup of remote repositories enables efficient tracking of contributions, facilitates peer reviews, and ensures reproducibility across research teams.
