### Use case: Data security and backup

Research data can be sensitive, and ensuring its safety is crucial. 
By using remote repositories, researchers can create secure backups of their datasets and analysis code.
Git hosting platforms offer authentication protocols like SSH and Personal Access Tokens (PATs), which enhance data security during transmission.
This is particularly important in the context of ensuring the ethical handling of research data and protecting datasets from accidental deletion or corruption on local machines.
Please note that data privacy can only be verified on remote repositories hosted by your institution.
