### Use case: Tracking your work

It's common to perform multiple analyses, run experiments, or manipulate datasets over time.
By creating a Git repository, you can track every change you make to your analysis scripts, experimental code, or research notes.
This helps in keeping a detailed history of your work, allowing you to revert back to any previous version if needed.
