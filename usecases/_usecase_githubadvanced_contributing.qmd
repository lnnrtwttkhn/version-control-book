### Use case: Collaborating on open-source research tools

Many research tools, data analysis pipelines, and statistical libraries are developed and maintained in open-source repositories on platforms like GitHub.
Learning to fork repositories and submit pull requests enables researchers to contribute improvements, bug fixes, or new features to widely used tools.
For example, a researcher working with a statistical package in R can fork the repository, make improvements or fix bugs, and submit a pull request to help the research community.
