## Use case: Tracking the version used for paper submission

When submitting a scientific paper, it's crucial to know exactly which version of your code was used to generate the results.
By tagging the commit with a descriptive name (e.g., `paper-submission-v1`), you can easily refer back to the exact state of your code and data that produced the results in the submission.
This ensures reproducibility and helps to quickly trace the source of your published findings.
