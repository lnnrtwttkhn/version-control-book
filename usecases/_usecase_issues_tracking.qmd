### Use case: Tracking research tasks and experiments

Researchers can use GitHub Issues to break down their projects into smaller, manageable tasks, such as experiments, data analysis, or manuscript writing.
Each issue can represent a task, which can be assigned to specific team members, prioritized, and tagged for easier management.
This approach enhances task organization, ensuring accountability and progress tracking throughout the research process.
