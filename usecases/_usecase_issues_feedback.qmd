### Use case: Managing and addressing reviewer feedback

When submitting research for publication, researchers often receive feedback from multiple reviewers.
GitHub Issues can help organize and manage these comments by creating individual issues for each set of feedback.
This makes it easier to track which changes have been addressed and to link specific changes to the corresponding reviewer's comments.
