### Comparing changes between submission versions

When revising a paper based on reviewer feedback, it's important to track what has changed between the original submission and the revised version.
Tagging the first submission (e.g., `submission-v1`) and the revised version (e.g., `revision-v1`) allows you to easily compare the differences, ensuring that the revisions are clearly documented and traceable.
