When authenticating with GitHub on macOS, you may notice that the password doesn't show up in the command line as you type it.
This is normal behavior to ensure security. 
You can still enter your password (or delete what you typed) even though it doesn't appear on the screen.
You can also copy and paste text, for example your PAT from GitHub.
When authenticating on Windows, a new window might pop up in which you can enter your PAT.
