As a first step, try going through the process again, whilst paying special attention to doing every step carefully.
Oftentimes, there is some confusion when copying the SSH key to the clipboard or when entering a new passphrase, as there's no visible feedback.
After entering the [command for copying](remotes-intro.qmd#copying-the-public-ssh-key-to-your-clipboard) the SSH key, you can usually trust that it is in your clipboard and move on to the next step.
Similarly, be cautious what you are typing in as a passphrase, as you can't see what you are entering. 
If you don't want a passphrase, simply click enter twice when asked to set one up, leaving the passphrase empty.  
Another issue could be that you have a pre-existing SSH key set up. 
You will get a warning about this and can simply use this pre-existing one to connect to your remote server of choice.

If none of these were the source of your issues, check out the [GitHub SSH key troubleshooting](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh) documentation or the [GitLab troubleshooting SSH](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/ssh_troubleshooting/) site.
