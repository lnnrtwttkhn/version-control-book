In this situation, you command line probably looks like one of these examples:

```{zsh, filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
echo "Hello World
>
>
>
```

```{zsh, filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false
git commit -m "Add filename.txt
>
>
>
```

You can try one of the following solutions:

1. Close the quotation marks by entering another `"`.
1. Abort the command by typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> simultaneously and repeat it (now with quotation marks closed).
