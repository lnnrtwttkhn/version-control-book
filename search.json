Whether you’re conducting experiments, writing code, collaborating with scientific peers, or managing complex data sets, Git provides a robust framework to boost the efficiency, reproducibility, and collaboration of your work. While this book was developed with scientists in mind, it’s open to anyone who wants to learn more about Git. We try to avoid technical jargon as much as we can. When we discuss best practices in using Git commands, we try to offer multiple alternatives but also give opinionated recommendations as guidance to new users.",

    "section": "How to use this book?",
    "text": "How to use this book?\nGit is fundamentally a command-line tool which means you typically interact with it by typing text-based commands into a small command-line window rather than clicking on buttons in a graphical user interface (GUI) as in many other applications. This book focuses on teaching Git from the command line. While the command line is arguably the rockier road to learning Git, we believe that it provides more long-term benefits and allows to make use of the full potential of Git. This book therefore also covers basics of the command line to teach you just enough to interact with Git via the command line effectively. That being said, if you prefer to interact with Git via a graphical user interface, you can still learn about the fundamental concepts of Git in this book and then implement them in your preferred GUI. We therefore also showcase a few popular Git GUIs.\nWe also believe in learning by doing and try to focus on implementation as much as possible. The concepts introduced in this book are accompanied by practical examples, hands-on exercises and quizzes. Feel free to follow the exercises to gain the necessary “muscle-memory” to start using Git in your day-to-day work. Try out the commands in each chapter, play around with them or apply them to a project of yours!\nThis book was initially created for the full-semester course “Effective Progress Tracking and Collaboration: An Introduction to Version Control of Code and Data” at University of Hamburg, Germany. The book is therefore structured for a course that is spread out across multiple sessions. Each chapter and the accompanying quizzes and exercises should roughly fill 90 minutes of class time during a course.\nWhile this book is available in both HTML and PDF formats, we recommend using the HTML version for the most up-to-date content. The HTML version is continuously updated with new material, corrections, and interactive elements, ensuring you always have access to the latest information. The PDF version is a static snapshot and may become outdated over time, making it useful for offline reading and archival but less reliable for the most current information.",

So then researcher 2 comes in and they help you implementing this feature. More files are created, but no ideas how to name them. Person 3 has a lot of ideas but is not editing the files directly. So script v-3 is created. One you realize that this is becoming complicated, you create a meta document that you want to use to keep track of the project progress. Then you realize that you software has bugs and you can’t figure out when this bug has occurred for the first time. Time has passed and you ask yourself: what is the latest version of my script and where is it? When did I incorporate that new feature. who made that change and why? Your collaborator asks you to run version 2 of the script but you dont have it anymore. In a real-life situation, there might be many more people involved and many more documents.",

    "text": "1.4 Versions in multiple files\nIf you are a student or researcher you might be familiar with the situation illustrated in Figure 1.2: You are writing a paper and you are really excited because you finally have a full draft. To mark this, you call the file FINAL.docx and send it off to your advisor. Your advisor has a few comments, so you integrate those changes into a new version that you call FINAL_rev2.doc. You show your draft to your advisor again and again they have even more comments. So as there are more and more rounds of feedback your file naming system an get out of hand very easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: “notFinal.doc” - originally published 10/12/2012. “Piled Higher and Deeper” by Jorge Cham (phdcomics.com). All content copyright 1997-2023 Piled Higher and Deeper Publishing, LLC. (direct link).\n\n\n\nApart from the issues with file naming, a deeper point of this illustration with respect to research is, that there is rarely a point in scientific work where we are really confident that something is indeed the “final”  version.\nIf you can relate to the poor student Figure 1.2, it is quite likely that you have also already engaged in this form of version control.\nMore generally, this common way of implementing file versioning of files works by appending versions or descriptive labels to the filenames, or by adding initials at the end of the filename:\n\nfile_v1.docx, file_v2.docx, file_v3.docx, etc.\ndraft.docx to draft_comments_LW_final_edited.docx, etc.\n\nEvery time you make a critical change to a file, you duplicate it, rename it according to your versioning scheme and continue working in the duplicated file. While this approach might be manageable for a single file or user, it likely becomes messy when dealing with numerous files, repeated revisions, and multiple users, especially for large, long-term projects, as illustrated in Figure 1.2, Figure 1.3 and Figure 1.4. In such cases, more advanced version control systems may be necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: “Documents” by xkcd (xkcd.com).

(direct link).\n\n\n\n\nYour number one collaborator is yourself from six months ago and she doesn’t answer emails.\n\nIf you mostly work on your own or with a very small team, you might think that you will not encounter such situations. However, remember that your number one collaborator is yourself from six months ago and you will often find yourself in situations trying to remember what happened six months ago.\nImagine you were on a very long vacation (who would not like to imagine that!) and you would come back to a project folder as illustrated in Figure 1.4. Would you know which file to continue working with? Would you know how the different files related to each other? How could someone else start working with this project or how would you start working with this if you would get such a project folder from someone else? It is very difficult to understand how to work with this project and you will likely spend a lot of time figuring out what all the different files are, what they mean and why they are titled in such a way.\n\n1.4.1 Versions in a single file\nSome software can keep track of all the changes made to a file without making new copies of the file. This includes word processors like Microsoft Word’s Track Changes, Google Docs’ version history, or LibreOffice’s Recording and Displaying Changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisadvantages of version control using Word processors compared to Git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited Collaboration: Word processors’ track changes feature is primarily designed for collaboration within the application, making it difficult to collaborate with users who don’t have access to the same word processing software. In contrast, Git allows seamless collaboration across different platforms and tools.\nLimited Review Features: Beyond comments in the text itself, word processors lack the advanced review features offered by Git, such as pull requests and code comments. These features facilitate the review processes, making it easier to provide feedback and discuss changes.\nNon-Atomic Commits: In most word processors, tracking changes may lead to non-atomic commits, where multiple unrelated changes are combined into one. This can make it harder to understand the history and roll back specific changes when needed, compared to the precise commit system in Git.\nLimited Branching and Merging: Git provides powerful branching and merging capabilities, allowing for the creation of multiple branches for different features or experiments. Word processors often lack this level of branching and merging, making it harder to manage complex development workflows.\nNo Version Tagging: Git allows tagging specific versions, marking them as milestones or releases. Word processors generally lack this feature, which can be essential for identifying important points in the development process.\nLack of File-Level Versioning: Word processors typically track changes at the document level, lacking the ability to track changes at the file level. Git, on the other hand, allows version control for individual files, enabling more granular control over the project’s components.\nLimited Automation: Word processors may offer basic automation features, but they can’t match the automation capabilities provided by Git and GitHub, such as pre-commit hooks, continuous integration, and automated testing.\nDifficulty in Managing Large Projects: Word processors’ track changes feature may become less efficient and manageable as the project grows in size and complexity. Git, as a dedicated version control system, is better suited for handling large-scale projects.\nNo Remote Repositories: Word processors do not have built-in support for remote repositories like Git does. Remote repositories in Git enable decentralized collaboration and backup, making it easier to work with distributed teams.\nDependency on Proprietary Software: Using word processors for tracking changes ties the version control process to specific software vendors, limiting the flexibility and interoperability that Git offers as an open-source, widely-used tool.\n\n\n\n\nThis allows you to look at the file’s history and see how it has changed over time. Examples of such software include Google Drive, Dropbox, and Overleaf. You may have noticed that these services automatically save different versions of your files and allow you to go back to previous versions if needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisadvantages of Version Control using Dropbox and Google Drive compared to Git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLack of Fine-Grained Versioning: Both Dropbox and Google Drive offer basic versioning features, but they often lack the granularity provided by dedicated version control systems like Git. In version control systems, you can track changes at the file level, while Dropbox and Google Drive may only keep a limited history of entire documents.\nNo Code Collaboration Features: While Dropbox and Google Drive allow file sharing and real-time collaboration, they do not provide specialized features for collaboration, like pull requests, or conflict resolution, which are often essential in the development of research outputs.\nLimited Branching and Merging: Dropbox and Google Drive do not support branching and merging, making it challenging to manage complex development workflows, especially in collaborative projects.\nDependency on Third-Party Servers: When using Dropbox and Google Drive, version control relies on their servers and infrastructure. This dependence may raise concerns about data security, privacy, and the availability of the service.\nFile Size and Storage Limits: Both services have limitations on file sizes and storage space. This can be problematic for larger projects with numerous files or when working with large binary files.\nLimited Automation and Integration: Dropbox and Google Drive lack the extensive automation and integration options provided by Git. In Git, you can set up various automated workflows and integrate with continuous integration tools for smoother development processes.\nRevision Conflicts: Version control in Dropbox and Google Drive may not handle revision conflicts as effectively as Git. Resolving conflicts manually can be time-consuming and may lead to data loss or discrepancies.\nLimited Offline Capabilities: When working offline, accessing version history or performing version control tasks in Dropbox and Google Drive might not be as seamless as with Git, which is designed to work effectively in both online and offline environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Image from Chapter 3.1 on “Collaboration, Version Control, & GitHub” of the Mozilla Science Lab’s Study Group Orientation handbook, used under a Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 (direct download link)\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5 illustrates the concept of tracking versions within a single file. It illustrates a simplified linear project timeline (gray line). A version control system keeps track of the changes made to the file at specific time points (gray nodes in Figure 1.5). These nodes represent various actions such as additions (first node), deletions (second node), or edits to the content (third node). The blue arrows at the bottom indicate the ability to navigate along this linear timeline. By recording these changes, it becomes possible to access previous versions of the file. This means that you can go back and examine earlier versions or even revert the entire workflow back to a specific version, if needed. Rather than saving new files for each change, this system saves the changes within the same file, allowing for easier management and tracking of version history.\n\n\n1.4.2 Features of a version control system\n\nWhat: It keeps track of the changes made to a file when you edit it.\nWhen: It records the date and time when each change was made.\nWho It keeps a record of who made each change.\nWhy: It allows you to add a note explaining why you made a particular change.\n\nThe system takes snapshots of your project, giving them unique codes that include all these features. Instead of saving new files for each change, only the specific modifications made to the file are saved. This makes it easy to compare different versions, restore previous versions, and combine changes when needed.",

It was created by the Linux development community in 2005. Git is a software primarily written in C, but you don’t need to know C.\n\n1.5.1 Key features of Git\n\nFree, fast, and open source.\nIt is a distributed system, meaning everyone working on a project has a complete copy of it.\nMost operations in Git can be performed using local files and resources, minimizing the need for external dependencies.\nGit keeps a detailed history of changes, including what was changed, when it was changed, who made the change, and why it was made.\nYou can easily retrieve previous versions of your project, allowing you to see the progression of your work.\nGit forms the foundation for collaboration tools like GitHub and GitLab.\n\nWhen you use Git, it takes snapshots of your project whenever you choose. It then compares the current snapshot with the previous one and prompts you to provide a message explaining why you made the specific changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is Git called Git?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name “git” was given by the main developer Linus Torvalds when he created the software. Torvalds is well-known for his involvement in the development of the Linux kernel.\n\n“I’m an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First ‘Linux’, now ‘git’.” – Wikipedia: Git\n\nFor more insights and discussions about the name, you can refer to the README.md file on GitHub.\nThe name “git” was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very first version. He described the tool as “the stupid content tracker” and the name as (depending on your mood):\n\nrandom three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of “get” may or may not be relevant.\nstupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.\n“global information tracker”: you’re in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.\n“goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t”: when it breaks",

    "section": "1.8 Common misconceptions",
    "text": "1.8 Common misconceptions\n\n1.8.1 Misconception: Git is the same as GitHub\nOne of the most widespread misconceptions is that Git and GitHub are the same thing. Git and GitHub are two distinct but related tools in the world of version control.\nGit is a version control system (software installed on your computer) that allows you to track changes and manage the history of your files locally on your computer. It provides features such as branching, merging, and reverting to previous versions.\nGitHub is a web-based hosting service for your Git repositories, allowing you to store and share your Git projects online. GitHub provides additional collaboration features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools.\nIn summary, Git is the version control system itself, while GitHub is a hosting service built on top of Git. Git can be used independently without GitHub, but GitHub relies on Git for its functionality.\n\n\n1.8.2 Misconception: Git is only for code and programmers\nWhile version control systems like Git are often associated with software development (and are indeed highly valuable for managing code-related projects), they are not limited to code and not exclusive to developers. Version control can be beneficial for anyone working with files that undergo changes over time, including writers, designers, and data analysts.\n\n\n1.8.3 Misconception: Git is only for collaboration\nGit offers remarkable benefits for collaboration, but its value extends beyond working with others. It enables you to collaborate effectively with your past and future self, fostering valuable skills and boosting your confidence when collaborating with others. Even if you currently don’t have a specific reason to collaborate with others, trying Git on your own can be highly beneficial and rewarding.\n\n\n1.8.4 Misconception: Git auto-saves your changes\nUnlike automatic saving, where changes are continuously saved in the background, Git requires manual intervention to capture snapshots. You have to explicitly inform Git when you want to take a snapshot, indicating that you want it to acknowledge your changes. While this may sound annoying at first, the benefits of having full control over your version history will become apparent in later chapters of this book.",

To this day, the command line has persisted as a reliable (and sometimes the only) way to interact effectively with computer programs. Similarly, even though many GUIs for Git exist (for an overview, see the chapter on Graphical User Interfaces), Git is fundamentally a command-line tool.

    "section": "2.2 Terminology",
    "text": "2.2 Terminology\nBefore we begin with the basics of the command line, let’s start by defining some key terms that you will frequently encounter throughout this book:\nA file is a unit of digital data storage that can contain a variety of information, such as text, images or even programs. It is identified by a unique name and a file extension, which indicates the file’s format or type (for example, file.txt for a plain text file). Files are organized within a file system, allowing users to create, access, modify, and delete them.\nA folder is a container used in file systems to store and organize files and other folders. Folders provide a hierarchical structure that allows users to group and manage files, making it easier to locate and navigate through data.\nA directory is a more technical term for a folder, while folder is a user-friendly term for the same concept. In practice, the two terms are often used interchangeably and many operating systems have adopted the term “folder”.\nThe command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based way to interact with computer programs. Specifically, the term “command line” refers to the interface where users input text commands to communicate with the computer. Most people primarily use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to work with programs on their computer, but historically, text-based interfaces were more common. Often, the GUI can only access a limited set of features available through the CLI and some programs don’t even have a GUI and can only be used through the command line. This text-based interaction allows to perform various tasks, from running programs to managing files and folders.\nThe terminal, short for “terminal emulator”, is the application or program that you open on your computer to access the command-line interface. Terminals were used to connect to mainframe computers in the early days of computing. The terminal program creates a window in which you can type commands and see the output from these commands.\nThe shell is a software that interprets the commands you type into the terminal. It acts as a layer between you and the operating system. The shell processes the commands and communicates with the computer’s operating system to execute them. It allows you to perform various tasks that your operating system offers, such as managing files, running and stopping programs, and changing system settings, all through text commands. Examples of popular shells include Bash on Linux and macOS, and PowerShell on Windows.\nIn combination, in a typical scenario, you would open a terminal (the window), use the shell within that terminal to understand and process your commands, and interact with your computer through the command line interface provided by the terminal. That being said, the terms “shell”, “command line”, “command-line interface (CLI)”, and “terminal” are often used interchangeably and roughly refer to the same thing: a simple window showing a prompt and a blinking cursor (see Figure 2.1). In movies, when people hack into computers, they often type rapidly in this window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The command line (Bourne shell interaction in Version 7 Unix). License: CC0, Source: Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich “programming language” does the command line use?\n\n\n\n\n\nAs briefly described in the section on terminology, the default “programming language” of the command line is a version of the Shell. Examples of popular shells include Bash on Linux and macOS, and PowerShell on Windows. The program Git for Windows provides a Bash emulation that is used to run Git from the command line which generally behaves like Bash in Linux and macOS environments.",

Click on the tab for your operating system or computer environment for detailed information.\n\n Windows macOS Linux UHH JupyterHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Logo of the Git Bash program on Windows (Source: Git for Windows on GitHub)\n\n\n\nTo use Git effectively on Windows, you need access to a Unix Shell environment, which is not natively available on Windows systems. Unix Shells, such as Bash, provide the most comprehensive access to Git’s features and are the standard tool for interacting with Git. This is why installing an emulator like Git Bash is necessary. In this guide, we recommend using an emulator provided by Git for Windows, which grants you access to both the Bash shell and Git commands.\nFor an installation guide, you can check out the chapters on Installation and Setup. Once you have installed Git for Windows, you can open a terminal by launching the program called “Git Bash” from the Windows start menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Icon of the Terminal program on macOS (Source: Wikimedia Commons, License: Public Domain)\n\n\n\nYou can access your default shell through the Terminal program (see the icon in Figure 2.3) that can be found within the Utilities folder: There are (at least) three different ways to get there:\n\nIn the Finder, go to Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal.app\nIn the Finder, select the Go menu &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal.app\nActivate the Mac Spotlight search function, type Terminal in the search bar, and press the EnterEnter key.\n\nYou may want to keep the Terminal in your Dock to find it more easily, as shown in Figure 2.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Terminal icon in the Dock on macOS\n\n\n\nOn new Apple computers, especially those running recent versions of macOS, you might have to allow the Terminal access to certain files and folders after your initial commands. If a prompt appears asking for permission, you will need to confirm it to continue using Terminal with access to these files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmacOS Terminal: Bash or Zsh?\n\n\n\n\n\nOn an Apple computer running macOS Mojave or earlier versions, the default Unix Shell is Bash. Unix is a family of operating systems serving as the basis for Linux and macOS with the inclusion of a command line interface (or Unix Shell) as a key feature. For an Apple computer operating on macOS Catalina or later releases, the default Unix Shell is Zsh. Bash and Zsh are both programs, which are command-line interfaces for interacting with an operating system. Zsh is often considered better than Bash for its more advanced features and improved scripting capabilities. It also has extensive community-contributed plugins and themes. However, the change to Zsh was not a drastic shift for most users, since there a few practical differences.\nTo verify if your machine is configured to use a shell other than Bash, you can type the following command in your Terminal window (you will learn about the command that is used here, echo, in this chapter):\n\n\n\nCode\n\necho $SHELL\n\n\nIf the output is /bin/bash or a similar path, it means your default shell is set to Bash. This is the most common shell on Unix-based systems, including macOS.\nIf the output is /bin/zsh or a similar path, it means your default shell is set to Zsh.\nIf the output is a different path, it indicates that your shell is configured to use a different shell program. If your machine is configured to use a shell other than Bash, you can switch to Bash by opening a terminal and typing bash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich macOS version do I have installed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the upper-left corner of your screen, click on the  logo.\nSelect “About This Mac”: A dropdown menu will appear. Choose “About This Mac”.\nView the macOS Version: In the “About This Mac” window, you will see information about your Mac, including the macOS version. The version number will be listed under the “Overview” tab. For example, it might say “macOS Big Sur” or “macOS Monterey”, along with the version number (for example, “Version 11.4”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I customize the look of my shell?\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, you can check out Oh My Zsh.\n\nOh My Zsh is a delightful, open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration. It comes bundled with thousands of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes,\n\nIn addition, if you want to add syntax highlighting (similar to the code chunks in this book), check out zsh-syntax-highlighting.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo open a fresh terminal window on Linux, you can usually use a keyboard shortcut, which often involves pressing CtrlCtrl (control) + AltAlt + TT simultaneously. If this shortcut does not work, you can find the terminal application in your system’s applications menu and click on it to open a new window. Additionally, if you are already in a graphical environment, right-clicking on the desktop or within a file manager may offer an option to open a terminal in the current location.\n\n\nIf it is not possible for you to access a command line interface using your personal computer, you can use a remote solution with JupyterHub. JupyterHub is a web-based platform that allows multiple users to access an interactive computing environment on a shared server.\nIf you are a student at University of Hamburg, you can access a remote environment, using your university login credentials here:\nhttps://code.min.uni-hamburg.de\nSimply click on the link and log in.\nOnce you are logged in, you should be able to view the remote environment and create files using different programs like , Python  or Java .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Screenshot of JupyterHub, showing the start screen.\n\n\n\nIf you scroll down in the “launcher” window, there should be the option to open a terminal window. Your remote environment will be mostly empty, but you can move around and manage files just like you could on your own computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Screenshot of JupyterHub, showing the terminal.",

In our examples, we will use $ as the prompt. The important thing to remember is to not type the prompt, $, itself when entering commands. Only type the command that comes after the $ prompt. For this reason, we remove the $ prompt from all code examples in this guide. Also, remember to press the EnterEnter key after typing a command to execute it.\nAfter the prompt, you’ll see a text cursor that shows where you can type. The cursor can be a flashing or solid block, or it can be an underscore or a pipe symbol. You may have seen a similar cursor in a text editing program.\nKeep in mind that your prompt may look slightly different. Usually, in popular shell environments, your username and the host name appear before the $ symbol. For example, your prompt might look like this:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nwittkuhn@lip-osx-005509:~$",

    "section": "2.5 Navigating the file system",
    "text": "2.5 Navigating the file system\n\n2.5.1 Introduction\nYou are most likely familiar with using your computer mouse to click through folders in your file browser, or perhaps you use arrow keys and clicks in the File Explorer (on Windows) or Finder (on macOS) to manage your files.\nThe command line offers a different, one could say less intuitive, but very efficient and precise way to interact with your computer’s file system. Instead of relying on a graphical user interface, you use text-based commands to perform tasks like exploring the contents of folders, creating and deleting files, and moving between folders.\n\n\n2.5.2 Directory and file structure\nIn a file system, directories (or folders) and files are organized hierarchically to enable the storage and retrieval of data. Each level in the hierarchy is called a “level” or “depth”. In the context of file systems, the hierarchy of directories is often described as a parent-child relationship and folders are therefore often referred to as “parent directories” and “child directories” (for details, see Tip 2.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 2.2: What are “parent” and “child” directories?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of file systems, a “parent directory” and a “child directory” describe the relationship between directories (or folders).\n\nParent Directory: This is the directory that is “higher up” in the directory hierarchy and contains one or more “child directories”.\nChild Directory: A child directory is located “inside” or “below” a parent directory. It is contained within the parent directory and is considered subordinate to it, like a child in a family is part of the larger family unit.\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nparent $ tree\n.\n├── child1\n└── child2\n\n3 directories\n\n\nTo visualize this hierarchy, you can use the tree command in the command line. The tree command generates a graphical representation of the directory structure, displaying the parent directory along with its child directories and files in a tree-like format. This makes it easier to understand the organization of files and directories within a specific directory.\nNote: The tree command is natively available on Windows. For Linux and macOS users, you can install it via your package manager (for example, brew install tree, if Homebrew is installed) to achieve the same.\n\n\n\nThe root directory is the highest level in the hierarchy. On Unix-based systems (including macOS and Linux), the root directory is denoted by /. On Windows, it is typically denoted by a drive letter followed by \\ (for example, C:\\). While the fundamental concepts of directories and files are consistent across operating systems, there are some differences in folder structures between macOS (Unix-based) and Windows (for details, see Tip 2.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 2.3: Differences in folder structures between macOS and Windows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Windows macOS\n\n\nOn Windows operating systems, each drive, such as C: or D:, has its own root directory, denoted by the drive letter followed by a backslash, like C:\\. Windows uses the backslash (\\) as the directory separator. The Users folder, which typically contains the personal folders of all users on the system, is usually located in the root directory of the drive where Windows is installed. The standard path to the Users folder is C:\\Users.\nTo find or navigate to the Users folder in Windows, you can:\n\nUse the tilde symbol (~; for more details, see below): In Git Bash, you can use ~ to represent the home directory of the current user, which is typically C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;.\nNavigate directly using the command prompt. If your present working directory (use pwd; for details, see below) is at the root (C:\\), you can directly navigate to the Users folder by entering the command: cd Users. Alternatively, if you are not sure which drive you are currently on, you can switch to the C: drive by typing cd C: and then navigate to the Usersfolder with cd Users. An example path to a file within the Users directory on Windows might be:\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nC:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\file.txt\n\n\n\n\nOn macOS the root directory is denoted by /, which is also used as the directory separator. The home directory for a user is typically /Users/username/. An example path on macOS could be:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n/Users/username/Documents/file.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Current working directory\nThe current working directory is the location within your file system where a user or an application is presently performing file operations or running commands. The command pwd (short for “print working directory”) will display the directory that the shell is currently focused on in your file system.\n\n\n\nCode\n\npwd\n\n\n\n\n Click here to see the output of this command executed in the project directory of this guide.\n\n\n\n/home/runner/work/version-control-book/version-control-book\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.4 Command not found\nIf the shell cannot find the program you typed as a command, it will show an error message. This can happen if you made a mistake when typing the command or if the program for that command is not installed on your system. For example, if you made a mistake when typing the pwd command, and accidentally entered pws, the following error message might appear:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\npws: command not found\n\n\n\n\n2.5.5 Moving between folders\nThe cd command is used to change the current working directory (or “move” to a different directory in your file system). To use it, type cd followed by an argument, which is the path of the folder you want to navigate to. The path can be either absolute or relative.\nFor example, if you are on macOS and your current working directory is your home directory (for example, /Users/user), you can switch to the /Downloads folder by using either an absolute or relative path with the cd command:\n\n\n\nAbsolute path (Output)\n\n~$ cd /Users/user/Downloads\n~/Downloads$ pwd\n/Users/user/Downloads\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative path (Output)\n\n~$ cd Downloads\n~/Downloads$ pwd\n/Users/user/Downloads\n\n\nYou may notice that the prompt has been updated to show the new working directory. If a path starts with a forward slash (/), it is considered an absolute path. Paths that do not start with a forward slash are considered relative to the current working directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Bash case sensitive?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, in general Bash is case sensitive. This means that it distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters in commands and filenames. For example, if you created a file like banana.txt and then listed files that start with the letter B, the command line would tell you that there is No such file or directory. If you then listed files that start with the letter b, the command line would find the file.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ntouch banana.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nls B*\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nls: B* No such file or directory\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nls b*\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nbanana.txt\n\n\nNote that this case sensitivity might not apply to paths on your computer. For example, cd ~/Desktop and cd ~/desktop might both lead macOS users to their Desktop directory. Generally, if you’re experiencing different behavior, it’s possible that you’re using a file system or environment where case sensitivity is not enforced, or there may be other factors at play. Some file systems, such as those commonly used in macOS, are case-insensitive by default, while others, like those used in most Linux distributions, are case-sensitive. Additionally, some configurations or filesystem options can affect this behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.6 Paths with spaces\nIf a path contains a space, it needs to be enclosed in quotation marks to be recognized by the command line. Here is an example of a path with a space:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n/Users/User/Downloads/Directory with space/\n\n\nIf you attempt to use this path in a command without quotation marks, the command interpreter would understand it as three separate arguments since in command-line interfaces, spaces are typically used to separate different arguments or parameters. Navigating to this absolute path with spaces would look like this:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ncd '/Users/User/Downloads/Directory with space/'\n\n\nWhile the command line can handle paths (or files) with spaces in this way, we recommend to avoid spaces in folder and file names altogether, especially if you use the command line frequently. For example, change the name of a directory called my folder to my_folder, using an underscore instead of a space.\n\n\n2.5.7 Taking shortcuts\n\n2.5.7.1 Tilde: ~\nThe tilde symbol (~) provides a convenient and abbreviated way to refer to the user’s home directory, allowing us to easily construct paths relative to that directory. To quickly change the current working directory to your user’s home directory anywhere on your file system, we can use cd ~ which will transport us back to the user’s home directory.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ncd ~\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n~/Downloads$ cd ~\n~$ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding the tilde (~) on your keyboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Apple Windows (German keyboard layout)\n\n\nOn an Apple computer you can type the tilde (~) symbol by pressing the optionoption (option) key and the NN key simultaneously, then pressing SpaceSpace.\n\n\nOn a Windows PC with a German keyboard layout, you can type the tilde (~) by holding the AltGrAltGr key and pressing the ++ key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.7.2 Dot: .\nAnother symbol with a special meaning in paths, aside from ~, is the dot (.). It serves as a shorthand representation for the current working directory, and using it in a path means the reference remains within the same directory.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n~$ cd .\n~$\n\n\nIn turn, these two commands are equivalent:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n~$ cd ./Downloads\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n~$ cd Downloads\n\n\n\n\n2.5.7.3 Dot Dot: ..\nThe .. symbol is a shorthand representation for the parent directory of the current working directory (for a reminder about “parent” and “child” directories, see Tip 2.2). It can be used repeatedly, allowing cd .. to move up one folder and cd ../.. to move up two folders. This is useful for creating relative paths to other branches within a directory tree.\nFor instance, by executing the following sequence of commands, we will navigate horizontally (or sideways) to a folder located at the same hierarchical level as the current working directory:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n1~$ cd ~\n2~$ cd Downloads\n3~/Downloads$ cd ../Documents\n4~/Documents$ pwd\n/Users/user/Documents\n\n\n\n1\n\nMove to the user’s home directory using the ~ shorthand.\n\n2\n\nMove to the Downloads folder.\n\n3\n\nMove sideways to the Documents folder.\n\n4\n\nDisplay the current working directory using pwd.",

    "section": "2.6 Clean and efficient command line",
    "text": "2.6 Clean and efficient command line\nIn this section, we provide some tips and tricks to help you become more efficient when using the command line and execute commands cleanly.\n\n2.6.1 Autocompletion\nWhile using the command line, instead of typing out the full command or path, you can press the ⇥⇥ (Tab) key to automatically complete the rest of the command. Begin typing a command or the initial letters of a file or directory, for example:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ncd ~/Doc\n\n\nOnce you’ve typed a portion of the command or path, press the ⇥⇥ key. The command-line interface will attempt to auto-complete the command or path based on what matches your input. In this case for example:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ncd ~/Documents/\n\n\nIf there are multiple possibilities, pressing ⇥⇥ again will cycle through the available options. Auto-completion also works for system commands. For example, typing ls (you will find out more about this command below) and pressing ⇥⇥ might complete it to ls -l or ls -a. Auto-completion also works for the Git commands that will be introduced in the following chapters of this book.\n\n\n2.6.2 Command history\nUsing the Up and Down arrow keys on your keyboard allows you to quickly access and reuse commands without retyping them.\nAfter executing one or multiple commands, pressing the Up arrow key retrieves the most recent command. If you’ve navigated back using the Up arrow, pressing the Down arrow key moves you forward through the command history. You can continue to press Up and Down to cycle through the executed commands. To execute a command, hit EnterEnter, or you can edit it as needed before execution.\nThe main benefit of this is time efficiency. Instead of typing out the entire command, especially for lengthy or complex commands, you can retrieve and modify previous commands quickly. It also minimizes the chances of introducing typos or syntax errors when reusing commands. And it’s also the reason why the Up arrow key is among the earliest that needs replacement on software developers’ keyboards.\n\n\n2.6.3 Clearing the command line\nThe clear command is used to clear the content of your terminal, providing a clean and empty slate. It helps improve visibility by removing previous commands, outputs, and clutter from your terminal window.\nTo clear the content of the terminal screen, type and execute the clear command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nclear\n\n\nPress EnterEnter and the terminal screen will be cleared, leaving only a new prompt at the top of the window.\n\n\n2.6.4 Saving command line history\nWhen you exit the command line, your command history is not automatically saved by default. To review the commands you’ve used, you can use the history command, which works on both macOS and Windows (when using Git Bash).\nIf you’re interested in keeping your command history for documentation or learning purposes, you can easily save either your current session’s history or the entire history stored by your terminal to a text file using the following command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nhistory &gt; history.txt\n\n\nThis command will capture your entire command history and save it to a file named history.txt in your current directory. You can then view this file directly from the command line or through your usual file viewer.",

To provide additional instructions to a command, we can pass flags and arguments by typing them after the command name.\n\n2.7.1 Listing files in a specific directory\nTo list files in a specific folder (relative to the current working directory), we use the ls command followed by the name of the folder. For example, we can list the contents of the chapters folder in the project directory of this guide. In this case, chapters is a so-called “argument” to the ls command.\n\n\n\nCode\n\nls chapters\n\n\n\n\n Click here to see the output of this command executed in the project directory of this guide.\n\n\n\nbranches.qmd\ncommand-line.qmd\ncommand-line.rmarkdown\nfirst-steps-git.qmd\ngit-essentials.qmd\ngithub-advanced.qmd\ngui.qmd\ninstallation.qmd\nintro-version-control.html\nintro-version-control.qmd\nissues.qmd\nproject-management.qmd\nremotes-intro.qmd\nrewriting-history.qmd\nsetup.qmd\ntags-and-releases.qmd\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.2 Listing hidden files\nHidden files, often starting with a dot (.) in their names, are files that remain mostly hidden from the regular view in GUIs. They can serve different purposes, such as storing configuration settings, sensitive data, or temporary files. Hidden files can be accessed through the command line or by changing settings in the file manager to make them visible.\nTo view hidden files, we can use the -a (for “all”) flag in the ls command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nls -a\n\n\n\n\n Click here to see the output of ls -a executed in the project directory of this guide.\n\n\n\n.\n..\n.Renviron\n.Rprofile\n.all-contributorsrc\n.codespellrc\n.git\n.github\n.gitignore\n.quarto\n.zenodo.json\nCITATION.cff\nLICENSE\nMakefile\nREADME.md\n_affiliations.yml\n_authors.yml\n_book\n_courses.yml\n_extensions\n_metadata.yml\n_quarto.yml\n_variables.yml\nchapters\ncheatsheet.json\nchicago-author-date-note.csl\ncode\ncontents-listing.json\ncontents.html\ncontents.qmd\ncustom.scss\nexercises\nexercises-repos\nfunctions.R\ngithub-buttons.html\nindex.html\nindex.qmd\nmisc\nobjectives\nplausible.html\nrecipes\nreferences.bib\nrenv\nrenv.lock\nsite_libs\nstatic\nversion-control-book.Rproj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 2.4: How can I list only hidden files?\n\n\n\n\n\nTo list only hidden files, you can run the following command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nls -d .?*\n\n\nThe -d (or --directory) flag lists directory entries instead of contents and does not dereference symbolic links. The .?* argument will only state hidden files.\n\n\n Click here to see the output of ls -d .?* executed in the project directory of this guide.\n\n\n\n..\n.Renviron\n.Rprofile\n.all-contributorsrc\n.codespellrc\n.git\n.github\n.gitignore\n.quarto\n.zenodo.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe cautious when modifying hidden files!\n\n\n\nIt’s important to be cautious when modifying or deleting hidden files, as they can impact the proper functioning of the operating system and applications. This is also typically the reason why these files are hidden. Only listing hidden files (as explained in this section) does not modify them, so it’s generally safe to execute the ls -a command to view hidden files.\n\n\n\n\n2.7.3 Flags and arguments\nCommand-line commands can be extended using so-called flags and arguments. The difference between a flag and an argument is that a flag is used to modify the behavior of a command, while an argument provides additional input or information to the command.\n\n2.7.3.1 What is a flag?\nA flag is typically a single character or a combination of characters preceded by a hyphen (-) or double hyphen (--). It is used to enable or disable specific options or features of a command. Flags are optional and are used to customize the behavior of the command. An example for a flag is the -a flag in the ls -a command that is used to list all files in a folder.\n\n\n\nCode\n\nls -a\n\n\n\n\n2.7.3.2 What is an argument?\nAn argument is the actual input or information that is passed to a command to perform a specific action. It can be a value, a file name, a directory path, or any other data required by the command to complete its task. Arguments are often positioned after the command and any flags, and they can be mandatory or optional depending on the command’s requirements. An example for an argument is the path that is provided with the cd command to navigate to it.\n\n\n\nCode\n\nls ~/Desktop\n\n\n\n\n2.7.3.3 Multiple single-letter flags\nYou can combine multiple single-letter flags by using a single dash. For example, to instruct the ls command to list all files (including hidden files) in a long format that is easy to read for humans, you can use the following combination of flags:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nls -alh\n\n\n\n\n Click here to see the output of ls -alh executed in the project directory of this guide.\n\n\n\ntotal 348K\ndrwxr-xr-x 17 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:58 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:50 ..\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker   36 Sep  6 12:50 .Renviron\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker   48 Sep  6 12:50 .Rprofile\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker 2.1K Sep  6 12:50 .all-contributorsrc\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker   76 Sep  6 12:50 .codespellrc\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:58 .git\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:50 .github\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  118 Sep  6 12:50 .gitignore\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:58 .quarto\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  925 Sep  6 12:50 .zenodo.json\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  992 Sep  6 12:50 CITATION.cff\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  20K Sep  6 12:50 LICENSE\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  575 Sep  6 12:50 Makefile\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker 7.5K Sep  6 12:50 README.md\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  935 Sep  6 12:50 _affiliations.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  641 Sep  6 12:50 _authors.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:58 _book\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  939 Sep  6 12:50 _courses.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:50 _extensions\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker   86 Sep  6 12:50 _metadata.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker 3.4K Sep  6 12:50 _quarto.yml\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker 2.7K Sep  6 12:50 _variables.yml\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:58 chapters\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker 6.3K Sep  6 12:50 cheatsheet.json\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  23K Sep  6 12:50 chicago-author-date-note.csl\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:50 code\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  507 Sep  6 12:58 contents-listing.json\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  55K Sep  6 12:58 contents.html\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  636 Sep  6 12:50 contents.qmd\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  265 Sep  6 12:50 custom.scss\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:50 exercises\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:58 exercises-repos\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker 2.4K Sep  6 12:50 functions.R\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  145 Sep  6 12:50 github-buttons.html\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  44K Sep  6 12:58 index.html\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker 6.2K Sep  6 12:50 index.qmd\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:58 misc\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:50 objectives\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  118 Sep  6 12:50 plausible.html\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:58 recipes\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  12K Sep  6 12:50 references.bib\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:51 renv\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  16K Sep  6 12:50 renv.lock\ndrwxr-xr-x  9 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:58 site_libs\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 runner docker 4.0K Sep  6 12:58 static\n-rw-r--r--  1 runner docker  211 Sep  6 12:50 version-control-book.Rproj\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.3.4 Getting help\nGetting help with commands can differ between operating systems. See the instructions for Windows and macOS below.\n\n Windows macOS\n\n\nIf you want to know what flags and arguments a command supports, most commands provide usage information when you use the flag --help. For example, you can use the ls command together with the --help flag:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nls --help\n\n\nThis will list all possible flags you can use together with the ls command.\n\n\nOn macOS you can’t use the --help flag. Instead you can use the man command, in combination with your desired command. This will display the manual page for a specified command. You can navigate through the manual pages using the arrow keys, and you can exit by pressing q. For example:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nman ls",

If we want to create a directory in the current folder, we just need to use its name, as the path is assumed to be relative. For example, to create a new folder for your favorite recipes, we can use the following command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nmkdir recipes\n\n\nMake sure that the new folder is present by using the ls command, and then move into it by using the cd command.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ncd recipes\n\n\n\n\n2.8.2 Creating multiple folders\nNext, we will proceed to create multiple additional folders within the recipes project folder. The mkdir command allows us to create multiple directories simultaneously by providing multiple arguments, each representing a separate folder. For example, we might create the following three folders:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nmkdir vegetarian vegan glutenfree\n\n\n\n\n2.8.3 Creating files\nLet’s create some files in the recipes project folder. To do this, you can use your favorite text editor or the command line. In the command line, you can use the touch command to create a new empty file. The file doesn’t need to contain anything. For example, to create an empty file called recipes.txt, we can use the following command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ntouch recipes.txt\n\n\n\n\n2.8.4 Opening files\nTo open files, you can use your preferred text editor but also the command line. On the command line, you can use the start command on Windows (using Git Bash) or the open command on macOS. These commands will open the specified file in the default application associated with the file type.\n\n Windows (Git Bash) macOS\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nstart recipes.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nopen recipes.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.5 Outputting text\nThe echo command is a simple and versatile command used to display text or output it to files. It is commonly used in shell scripts and command-line operations to print messages, display variable values, or generate simple text files.\n\n2.8.5.1 Basic use of echo\nThe echo command outputs the text that follows it. For example, echo \"Hello, World!\" will display Hello, World! in the terminal.\n\n\n\nCode\n\necho \"Hello, World!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nHello, World!\n\n\n\n\n2.8.5.2 Using variables with echo\nYou can use echo to display the values of variables. For instance, echo $HOME will print the path of the home directory.\n\n\n\nCode\n\necho $HOME\n\n\n\n\n Click here to see the output of echo $HOME executed in the project directory of this guide.\n\n\n\n/home/runner\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.5.3 Using special characters with echo\nTo include special characters or commands in the text output, use quotes around the text. For example, the following command will display the current date:\n\n\n\nCode\n\necho \"Current date: $(date)\"\n\n\n\n\nCurrent date: Fri Sep  6 12:58:25 UTC 2024\n\n\n\n\n2.8.5.4 Writing short text into files\nThe echo command can also be used to write text to a file directly from the command line. By combining echo with the &gt;&gt; operator, you can add content to an existing file. For example, to add text to the recipes.txt file using the command line:\n\n\n\nCode\n\necho \"This is a list of all my favorite recipes.\" &gt;&gt; recipes.txt \n\n\nThis adds the provided text to the existing content of recipes.txt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference between using &gt;&gt; or &gt; with echo when writing short text into files\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you use the command echo \"Git is cool\" &gt;&gt; file.txt, it will append the text “Git is cool” to the end of the file file.txt. If the file does not exist, it will be created and the text “Git is cool” will be added. If the file already contains other text, the “Git is cool” text will be added after the existing text at the end of the file.\nOn the other hand, when you use the command echo \"Git is cool\" &gt; file.txt, it will write the text “Git is cool” to a file named file.txt. If the file already exists, it will overwrite its contents with the new text “Git is cool”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.6 Viewing file content\nIf you want to quickly view the content of a file without opening it, you can do so in the command line using the cat command. To display the content of a file, simply use cat followed by the file name. For example:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ncat recipes.txt \n\n\nThis command will output the entire content of the recipes.txt file to the terminal.\n\n\n Click here to see the output of the cat command applied to the .gitignore file in the project directory of this guide.\n\n\n\n/.quarto/\n/_book/\n.Rproj.user\n/env/\n.Rhistory\nstatic\n/.luarc.json\n.DS_Store\n*.html\n*.ipynb\n/exercises-repos/\n/recipes/\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.7 Moving folders and files\nLet’s say we want to move the recipes.txt file to the /vegan subfolder. We can use the mv command to move files and folders. The mv command requires two arguments: the first is the files or folders to be moved, and the second is the path where they should be moved. To move the recipes.txt file to the /vegan subfolder, the command would look like this:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nmv recipes.txt vegan\n\n\n\n2.8.7.1 Moving files to the parent directory\nLet’s assume that you moved the recipes.txt file to the /vegan subfolder, as shown above. Now let’s move the recipes.txt file back to the parent recipes folder. To do this, you can first cd into the /vegan subfolder and then use the .. shortcut (for details on .., see the section above) in combination with the mv command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ncd vegan\nmv recipes.txt ..\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.8 Renaming files and folders\nSuppose we don’t like the folder name vegan because recipes.txt actually contains recipes with meat. We can use the mv command to rename files and folders by moving them to a different location in the file system, for example meat, like this:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nmv vegan meat\n\n\n\n\n2.8.9 Downloading files\nThere are various ways how you can download files from the internet using the command line. Here, we present a simple approach using the tool wget.\n\n2.8.9.1 Using wget\nThe wget command is a powerful tool used to download files from the web directly through the command line. This is particularly useful for retrieving files from a remote server or downloading large datasets.\nTo download a file into your current directory, simply use the following syntax:\n\n\n\nCode\n\n1wget &lt;URL&gt;\n\n\n\n1\n\nReplace URL with the URL of the files(s) that you want to download.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you want to download the logo of this project, you could use the following command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nwget https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/static/logo.svg\n\n\nThis command will download logo.svg from the specified URL and save it in the current working directory.\n\n\n\n2.8.10 Wildcards\nNow let’s learn how to use so-called wildcards to perform actions on multiple files or folders at the same time. A wildcard is denoted by the symbol *, and it helps us select file system arguments that match certain patterns. For example, suppose we wish to display a list of all files of a certain file type (here, all files with the .yml file extension) in the current directory:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nls -alh *.yml\n\n\n\n\n Click here to see the output of the ls -alh *.yml command executed in the project directory of this guide.\n\n\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 runner docker  935 Sep  6 12:50 _affiliations.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 runner docker  641 Sep  6 12:50 _authors.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 runner docker  939 Sep  6 12:50 _courses.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 runner docker   86 Sep  6 12:50 _metadata.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 runner docker 3.4K Sep  6 12:50 _quarto.yml\n-rw-r--r-- 1 runner docker 2.7K Sep  6 12:50 _variables.yml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this output mean?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first column (-rw-r--r--) represents the file permissions. In Unix-like systems, it shows who can read, write, or execute the file. In this case, the files are readable and writable by the owner (rw-), readable by the group (r--), and readable by others (r--).\nThe second column (1) indicates the number of hard links to the file.\nThe third column (runner) is the username of the file’s owner. Here, the username is runner because the this online guide is build automatically on GitHub using GitHub Actions and runner refers to the computing environment where the build process is executed. If you would build the book on your computer, it would show your username.\nThe fourth column (docker) is the group associated with the file. Here, the group name is docker which again refers to the computing environment where this online guide is built.\nThe fifth column shows the size of the file. In this case there are just small textfiles included with the sizes ranging from 97B to 3.0K.\nThe next column (for example, Jan 18 20:39) display the date and time when the file was last modified.\nThe last column (for example, _affiliations.yml etc.) shows the name of each file.\n\n\n\n\nBy using the wildcard *, we can generate a list of all files ending with .yml. Similarly, we can apply the wildcard at the end of a path to match items starting with a specific letter, such as folders beginning with i:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nls -alh i*\n\n\n\n\n Click here to see the output of the command ls -alh i* executed in the project directory of this guide.\n\n\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 runner docker  44K Sep  6 12:58 index.html\n-rw-r--r-- 1 runner docker 6.2K Sep  6 12:50 index.qmd\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.11 Removing files and folders\nTo delete files and folders, you can use the rm command. Provide the path of the files or folders that you want to delete as the argument. However, if you want to remove a folder, you need to include the -r (or --recursive) flag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Be careful when using the rm command!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you use the rm command to delete files, they are removed entirely (!!!) from your system and cannot be retrieved from a “Recycle Bin” or “Trash” as when you delete files using the file browser!\n\n\n\nFor example, to remove the glutenfree folder, you would use the following command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nrm -r glutenfree\n\n\n\n\n2.8.12 Combining commands\nCombining commands in the command-line using semicolons ; is a way to execute multiple commands sequentially on a single line. Each command is separated by a semicolon, and they are executed one after the other, regardless of the success or failure of the previous command.\nFor example, let’s say you want to (1) create a new directory, (2) move into that directory, and then (3) list the files in that directory, all in one go. You can use semicolons to combine these commands like this:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nmkdir new_directory ; cd new_directory ; ls\n\n\nThis will (1) create a new directory called new_directory, (2) change the current working directory to new_directory and (3) list the files in this new directory.",

Open the Terminal and type:\n\ngit --version\n\nIf Git is installed, you should receive an output similar to:\n\ngit version 2.39.2 (Apple Git-143)\n\nIf Git is not installed you will get a prompt asking you if you wish to install it along with Xcode command line tools. You also may be asked for your administrator password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError message: xcrun: error\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem\nDid you receive the following error message when entering a git command into the Terminal?\n\nxcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun\n\nSolution\n\nxcode-select --install\n\nThis will open a dialogue box.

Hit Continue through the prompts without modifying the installation destination or other settings. You may be asked for your administrator password.\n\n\n\n3.1.2  Windows\nTo use Git on a Windows computer, we recommend the installation of “Git for Windows”, which includes both the Bash shell and Git. You can download this program at gitforwindows.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Screenshot of gitforwindows.org\n\n\n\nOn the homepage, you should see a prominent download link.\nClick on it to start downloading the installer. Once the installer is downloaded, double-click it to run the installation. During the installation process, you’ll be presented with various options and settings. We recommend to leave all settings to their standard configuration, unless you have a specific need to e.g. change the installation destination.\n          \nOnce you have finished selecting your preference, click the install button to begin the installation process.\nThe installer will copy the necessary files and set up Git and Git Bash on your system. Once the installation is complete, you’ll see a “Finish” button and the option to directly launch a Bash window.\n \nNow a Bash window opens up and you should be able to use the command line and Git!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Screenshot of “Git Bash”\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3  Linux\nCheck if you have git installed by opening your terminal and running:\n\ngit --version\n\nIf git is not installed, install it using your package manager, e.g., by running the following command in the terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get install git",

To read or write configuration values at this level, you need administrative privileges. To set a system-level configuration, use the following command syntax:\n\ngit config --system &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;\n\nGlobal-level or user-level configuration: This level is specific to an individual user. Configuration values set at this level will be applied to all repositories owned by the user. To set a global-level configuration, use the following command syntax:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit config --global &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;\n\n\nRepository-level configuration: This level is specific to a particular Git repository. The configuration values set at this level override values set at the system-level and user-level configurations for that specific repository. By default, Git reads from and writes to this file when you use the git config command without any additional options.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit config --local &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;\n\n\nKeep in mind that when you set configurations at different levels, Git looks for the configuration from the most specific level to the least specific (local &gt; global &gt; system). The configuration set at the local level will override the configurations set at the global and system levels for that particular repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind our more: How to enable copy and paste in Git Bash?\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, copy and pasting is disabled Git Bash for Windows. To enable it, follow these steps:\n\nClick the Git Bash icon on the top-left corner, and choose options.\nGo to Keys menu and enable Copy and Paste (Ctrl/Shift + Ins) option.\nApply and Save.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Identifying yourself\nBefore you start using Git, it’s important to set your username and email address. This information is crucial because Git uses it to identify the author of each change you track with Git. By associating your changes with your username and email, it allows others (including future you) to see who made the changes which facilitates transparency and collaboration within a project. You will be able to connect Git to remote repositories like GitHub using this email address. So it makes sense to set your email address to the one you use (or will use) to create a GitHub account.\nSetting your username and email address is a one-time setup process on a new computer, but you can always update them later, if needed. To perform this configuration using the command line, use the following command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\n1git config --global user.name \"Jane Doe\"\n2git config --global user.email jane@example.com\n\n\n\n1\n\nReplace \"Jane Doe\" with your own username.\n\n2\n\nReplace jane@example.com with your own email address.\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to replace \"Jane Doe\" with your own username and jane@example.com with your own email address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ: Which username should I use for Git?\n\n\n\n\n\nYour username will be attached to the changes you track with Git, so choose something that is meaningful and informative for others and yourself in the future. After all, one main purpose of Git is to be able to track of who made which changes and when. This can help a lot in the future when you need to figure out who to talk to about a particular change. Your username can be your real name, your GitHub username, or something informative about you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: Consider your privacy preferences!\n\n\n\nWhen you set your username and email address in Git, keep in mind that this information about you will be stored in the Git history and associated with every change you make. This means your username and email could be visible to anyone who has access to the repository, potentially revealing personal details such as your first and last name.\nIf privacy is a concern, you might consider using a pseudonym or a dedicated email address for Git, especially if you are contributing to public repositories. For example, GitHub allows you to use a noreply email address associated with your GitHub account to keep your personal email private.\nAlways be mindful of the information you share, as it can be difficult to remove or change once it’s added to a Git repository.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Configuring the default name of the initial branch\nGit uses a concept called “branches” to allow working on different versions of the same project. Branches will be introduced in a later chapter of this book. For now, you can think of branches as parallel versions of your repository contents.\nOn most installations of Git, by default, the name “master” is used for the initial branch when creating a new Git repository. However, there has been a growing movement to transition to using “main” as the default branch name instead. One of the main motivations behind this change is to promote inclusivity and remove offensive terminology from the default Git workflow (you can read more about the reasons here or here). To configure the default branch name to “main” in Git, you can use the following command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit config --global init.defaultBranch main",

    "text": "4.4 Configuring your text editor\nSometimes Git might open up a text editor inside the command line, and it can be annoying if you end up in an editor that you don’t like or don’t know how to use. The standard text editor on macOS and “Git for Windows” is called Vim (or Vi), which has a (perhaps questionable) popularity for being difficult to use. You can find more information about the challenges of using Vim (and some funny memes) here. To check out which text editor Git is using, you can use:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit config --get core.editor\n\n\nIf you have not changed your text editor yet, the output should be empty. This means that Git is using the command line’s default editor, which should be Vim if you are using macOS or “Git for Windows”. To make sure, you can use:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit var GIT_EDITOR\n\n\nIf the output is vim or vi, your system’s default editor is indeed Vim / Vi. Vim is an improved version of Vi, but there are virtually no differences that are relevant for learning Git or the scope of this book. In this situation, you can either pick up on the basics of Vim (see below) or simply change the text editor. Also note that, depending on your workflow, you will typically not have to use a text editor in the command line a lot. For beginners, we recommend to become familiar with the basics of your system’s default text editor (in most cases, Vim) to be able to perform basic operations (at least, how to exit it) when interacting with Git.\n\n4.4.1 Vim Basics\nTo start Vim, open the command line and type vim followed by the filename of the file that you want to edit (for example, vim file.txt). In Vim, you have two main modes: Insert mode for typing your text and Normal mode for navigation and command execution. Vim will always start in Normal mode, which can be confusing. The command line will probably look like this:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n~\n~\n~\n\n\nTo switch from Normal mode to Insert mode, press I on the keyboard. You can see that -- INSERT -- appears at the bottom of the command line window. This should look like this:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n~\n~\n~\n-- INSERT --\n\n\nYou can now start writing any text into the file. This could look like this:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nCool, I am using Vim!\n~                                                                         \n~                                                                         \n~                                                                         \n-- INSERT --\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ: I entered vim without providing a filename like filename.txt? What do I do now?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you entered vim into the command line without providing a filename, a welcome screen similar to the following will appear:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n~                                                                               \n~                              VIM - Vi IMproved                                \n~                                                                               \n~                               version 9.0.2136                                \n~                           by Bram Moolenaar et al.                            \n~                 Vim is open source and freely distributable                   \n~                                                                               \n~                        Help poor children in Uganda!                          \n~                type  :help iccf&lt;Enter&gt;       for information                  \n~                                                                               \n~                type  :q&lt;Enter&gt;               to exit                          \n~                type  :help&lt;Enter&gt;  or  &lt;F1&gt;  for on-line help                 \n~                type  :help version9&lt;Enter&gt;   for version info                 \n~                                                                               \n\n\nTo make things easy: You can exit Vim again by pressing Esc, then entering :q! and pressing Enter.\n\n\n\nWhen you’re done writing, here’s how to save and exit Vim:\n\nSwitch back to Normal mode using Esc.\nSave your changes by typing :w (then press Enter)\nTo exit Vim, type :q (and press Enter).\n\nYou can also combine commands in Vim, so you can use :wq to save your changes and exit Vim with just one command (don’t forget to hit Enter). This will look like this:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nCool, I am using Vim!\n~                                                                         \n~                                                                         \n~                                                                         \n:wq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError: E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis error might occur if you made changes to a file using Vim and tried to exit Vim using :q but didn’t use :w before to save the changes. Vim therefore warns you that you didn’t “write since last change”:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n~\n~\n~\nE37: No write since last change (add ! to override)\n\n\nYou can now decide to either (1) save the change using :w then quit using :q (or combine with :wq) or, as Vim suggests, override or discard the changes using :q!.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n~\n~\n~\n:q!\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a more detailed and interactive tutorial of Vim, you can check out openvim.com. For more information about common Vim commands, also see the box below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more: Vim commands\n\n\n\n\n\nTo navigate through the text in Normal mode without using the arrow keys, you can use h to move left, j to move down, k to move up, and l to move right. If you need to delete a character in Normal mode, simply press x. This will remove the character under the cursor. To delete an entire line, use dd.\nUndoing changes is also straightforward in Vim. Press u in Normal mode to undo the last action, and Ctrl + r to redo an action if you’ve undone too much.\nSometimes, you might want to search for a specific word or phrase in your file. To do this, press / followed by the word or phrase you’re looking for, and then press Enter. Vim will jump to the first instance of that text. Press n to find the next instance or N to find the previous instance.\nTo replace one word with another throughout the entire file, you can use the substitute command: :%s/old/new/g. This command will replace all occurrences of \"old\" with \"new\". If you want to confirm each replacement, add a c at the end: :%s/old/new/gc.\nFor editing multiple lines at once, you can enter Visual mode by pressing v in Normal mode. Move the cursor to select multiple lines or characters, then you can perform operations on that selection, like deleting with d or copying with y. To paste the copied or cut text, use p.\nTo open a new file or switch between multiple files in Vim, use the :e filename command. To list all open files (buffers) and switch between them, use :ls to list and :b number to switch, where number is the buffer number.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Changing your text editor\nIf you want to change the standard text editor to one that you are more comfortable with, there a lot of alternatives like Nano, Visual Studio Code or Notepad++. If you have decided to use a different text editor you can use the following command (replace \"EDITOR_NAME\" with the name of your preferred text editor):\n\n\n\nCode\n\n1git config --global core.editor \"EDITOR_NAME\"\n\n\n\n1\n\nReplace \"EDITOR_NAME\" with the name if your preferred text editor.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, to set Nano as the default text editor, use the following command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit config --global core.editor \"nano\"\n\n\nMore information about associating text editors with Git, for example Visual Studio Code, can be found in the GitHub documentation.\nFrom now on, when Git requires you to interact with a text editor, it will open the one that you have set. If you ever want to change your Git editor in the future, you can repeat the above steps and specify the new editor command or path.",

    "text": "4.7 Helpful guardrails\nEspecially if you are new to Git (but not only then!), you might be worried that something will go terribly wrong, that you will lose files beyond recovery, or that you will break your computer. While we won’t assure you that this will not happen (if you try really hard, you can always break stuff), it’s quite unlikely that something bad will happen. In this section, we therefore collect pieces of advice and other tricks to make your Git journey as smoothly as possible.\n\n4.7.1 Preventing a Git repository in your home directory\nIn the next chapter, you will take your first steps with Git. This will involve creating your first Git repository in a folder on your computer. It is then possible to track changes in the files in that folder.\nWe strongly recommend that you don’t create a Git repository in your home directory! Otherwise, you might start tracking changes in all files in your home directory, which usually means all the files that you have saved under your user name, including applications and system files. Always remember that you need to navigate to the folder first where you want to create a new Git repository or work on an existing one 1.\nTo prevent accidentally creating a Git repository in your home directory, you can run the following command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ntouch ~/.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMini Exercise: What does the touch command do in this case?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command creates an empty file called .git in your home directory. The path ~/ specifies the path to your home directory. If you then run the git init command to initialize a new Git repository (find out more about this in the next chapter), the following (desired) error will appear and no Git repository is created in your home directory:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nfatal: invalid gitfile format: /Users/user/.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this guardrail shortly before you create your first Git repository.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you implement this guardrail but haven’t created your first Git repository yet, commands like git config will stop working as expected. To prevent this, we recommend the following procedure:\n\nUse git config to configure Git.\nCreate the guardrail as explained in this section.\nCreate your first Git repository (see next chapter).\n\nYou can also set up this guardrail after you created your first Git repository in a suitable location. There is no required order, we only want to make sure Git works as expected and prevent you from creating a Git repository in your home directory.\n\n\n\nThanks to Eamon Caddigan for this tip!",

A repository is a regular folder on your computer that is tracked by Git. The full history of changes of a project and information about who changed what and when is also stored by Git in this folder.\nTo create a new Git repository, you need to initialize a folder as a Git repository. First, let’s create an empty folder using the command line1. Alternatively, you can create a new folder using the graphical user interface of your file browser.\nNext, use the command line to navigate to the folder which you want to initialize as a Git repository 2. Once you are in the desired folder, run the git init command to initialize the folder as a Git repository:\nCode\n\ngit init\nYou should see an output similar to:\nOutput\n\nInitialized empty Git repository in /foldername/.git/\nCongratulations on successfully initializing your first Git repository! 🎉\nGit is now able to track your file(s) and the changes you make in this folder. You only need to use git init once per folder.\nYou can also skip creating a folder manually and only use the git init command:\nCode\n\n1git init /Users/yourusername/Desktop/foldername\n\n\n\n1\n\nReplace /Users/yourusername/Desktop/foldername with the (absolute or relative) path to the folder which you want to initialize as a Git repository.\nGit will create an already initialized folder at the path and with the name you use. Check your current working directory to be sure that you create the Git repository in the desired location 3. You can use both absolute and relative paths as arguments to the git init command to specify the location of your Git repository 4.\nGit can now track every file you move, create or change in this folder. You can use this folder like any other normal folder on you computer. The only difference is the tiny but powerful folder called .git within it, which stores the full history of files and relevant metadata of your project, thereby enabling the tracking of your project progress.",

    "text": ".git folder?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to verify that Git is tracking your folder, you can look for the .git folder. To do this navigate to the correct folder and use ls -a to receive a list of hidden files. If the folder has been initialized as a Git repository, you should see a folder called .git. Generally, you should not manually modify the .git folder, since doing so can corrupt your repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t mess with the .git folder!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe .git folder in a Git repository contains all the essential information and configuration for the repository to function properly. Tampering with this folder can have serious consequences, as it can lead to data loss, corruption, or the inability to use the repository effectively. It’s essential to only modify Git repositories through Git commands and established workflows to ensure the integrity and reliability of your project. In short: Don’t mess with the .git folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndoing git init\n\n\n\n\n\nShort version (if you know what you are doing): To remove Git from a folder run:\n\n\n\nCode\n\nrm -rf .git\n\n\nLong version: You may find yourself in a situation where you want to undo the initialization of a Git repository. For example, you initialized the wrong folder as a Git repository. Undoing an initialization is straightforward but should be approached with caution. To completely remove the Git setup from a folder, you can delete the .git directory within it. This is where Git stores all the information about the repository, including the history of commits and configurations. To do this, navigate to the directory of your Git project in the terminal and run the command rm -rf .git. This command forcefully (-f) removes (rm) the .git directory and all of its contents recursively (-r), effectively undoing the git init command. Be aware that this action is irreversible and will permanently delete the repository’s history and configurations, leaving you with just the working directory files (the files currently in your project folder).\n\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Subfolders in a Git repository\nGenerally, you can organize your Git-initialized project folder in any way you want (just like a regular folder on your computer), for example by creating subfolders within your repository. This allows for better organization of your files and directories, making it easier to manage larger projects. Git will also track the changes in these subfolders. Git commands are designed to work recursively from the parent directory in which git init was executed 5. This means that if you use Git commands within any of the child directories (subfolders) of the repository, those commands will still apply to the entire repository context. For example, if you make changes to a file within a subfolder and commit those changes, Git will process this action in the context of the parent repository, ensuring that the entire project’s history is maintained cohesively.\n\n\n5.1.2 Checking the status of the Git repository\nAfter you initialized a Git repository, you can use git status to receive the current file tracking status from Git.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit status\n\n\nIf you initialized a new Git repository, you should see an output similar to the following:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nOn branch main\n\nNo commits yet\n\nnothing to commit (create/copy files and use \"git add\" to track)\n\n\nLet’s unpack what this output means:\n\nOn branch main\nThis tells you that you are currently working on the main branch of your Git repository. A branch is like a separate line of development in your project. The default branch is often configured during the setup of Git. You can find out more about branches in a later chapter.\n\n\nNo commits yet\nThis means that there haven’t been any changes or updates made to the repository yet. You haven’t created or saved any new versions of your project. The term “commit” will be introduced below.\n\n\nnothing to commit (create/copy files and use \"git add\" to track)\nThis indicates that there are no new changes to save or “commit” to the repository at this moment. Git is suggesting that if you want to start tracking changes, you should create or copy some files into the repository’s directory and then use the git add command to tell Git to start keeping track of those files. Once you’ve added files with git add, you can then commit those changes to save them in your project’s history (for more details, see below).\nAs you can see git status gives you an overview, which files Git is tracking for you. The git status command is helpful for understanding the current state of your Git repository and we recommend to use it frequently, especially before adding or committing changes in files to the Git history (see below for more details).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon git status flags\n\n\n\n\n\n-s: Provides a more compact and simplified output, showing only the file status in a short format.\n-b: Includes information about the branch you are currently on along with the status.\n-u: Shows untracked files in the output.\n-uno: Suppresses the display of untracked files.\n-v: Provides more detailed information, including additional status information about ignored files.\nYou can use these flags in combination. For example, git status -s -b will display a short and concise output along with the branch information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Adding files to the Git repository\nIn the next step, please create an empty text file within your repository 6.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ntouch filename.txt\n\n\nYou can also use any other method or application for creating files.",

    "section": "5.2 Status, staging and committing",
    "text": "5.2 Status, staging and committing\n\n5.2.1 Checking the status of your Git repository again\nAfter you initialized a Git repository and added a file, you can use git status to receive the current file tracking status from Git again. This time, you should see an output similar to the following:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nOn branch main\n\nNo commits yet\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to include in what will be committed)\n  \n  filename.txt\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Introduction to staging and committing\nWe will now introduce central concepts of Git that might not be super intuitive if you learn about them for the first time, so read carefully. After initializing a folder with Git, it’s capable of recording changes in your files, but it won’t do so automatically. In Git, the process of saving changes involves two steps: the staging area and commits. The staging area is like a preparation area where you gather and organize your changes before saving them as a snapshot. You can choose which changes to include in a snapshot by adding them to the staging area using git add. Once you are happy with the changes in the staging area, you create a commit with git commit. A commit is like taking a snapshot of your project at a specific moment, capturing all changes in the staging area and saving them as a new version of your project. Commits serve as milestones to track your project’s progress and allow you to revert to previous versions if needed. As further introduction to the basic workflow of Git you can check out the last two minutes of the YouTube video: Version control for reproducible research from BERD Academy, which explains the process very vividly.\n\n\n5.2.3 Staging\nYou can use git add to place new or modified files in the staging area. The staging area acts as a space for gathering changes you plan to commit shortly. It bridges between your modified files and the next commit.\nFor example, you can stage a specific file like this:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit add filename.txt\n\n\nIf you use git status again, your file(s) should now show up under “Changes to be committed”.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nOn branch main\n\nNo commits yet\n\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n    new file:   filename.txt\n\n\nYour change to the file (or the addition of it to the project directory) is now staged. Especially if you have many files, you don’t have to add every file one by one, but you can simply use the -A flag. This means if you want to stage every file in your project for preparation of your next commit, you can use:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit add -A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe careful when staging all files!\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially for existing project folders that have a lot of files in them, be careful when you stage and / or commit all files in the project directory. Git might start to track files that you are actually not interested in tracking. We recommend to use git status frequently to check which files are in the staging area and will therefore be added to the next commit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon git add flags\n\n\n\n\n\n-A: Adds all changes, including modifications, deletions, and new files, in the entire working tree.\n-u: Adds modifications and deletions, but not new files.\n--ignore-errors: Ignores errors when adding files, allowing the command to continue even if some files cannot be added.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Committing\nNow that the changes to your file(s) are staged, you are ready to create a commit.\nIn simple terms, a commit in Git is like taking a snapshot of your project at a specific moment in time. It’s a way to save the changes you’ve made to your files. When you make a commit, you’re saying, “I want to remember what my project looks like right now”. Each commit in Git includes a record of the changes you’ve made, a description of what you did, and a unique identifier. Commits are like milestones in your project’s history, and they allow you to keep track of all the different versions of your work over time. You can go back to any commit to see what your project looked like at that point or even undo changes if needed. Commits help you manage and document the history of your project.\nTo create a commit, use the git commit command followed by the flag -m and a commit message in quotes that describes the changes you made. The commit message should be short yet informative, providing enough detail to understand the purpose of the commit. If you just use git commit without adding a commit massage, the text editor of your choosing, opens up and lets you type in a commit message.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit commit -m \"Add filename.txt file\"\n\n\nYou should see output similar to the following:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n[main (root-commit) e9ea807] Add filename.txt file\n 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\n create mode 100644 filename.txt\n\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully created your first commit in the Git repository. 🎉\nCommits are the core elements of version control and the “commit history” of your Git repository. They allow you to track the history of your project and easily revert changes if needed.\nYou can use the same workflow of git add and git commit for every file you add or make changes in.\n\n5.2.4.1 Rock climbing analogy\n\nUsing a Git commit is like using anchors and other protection when climbing. If you’re crossing a dangerous rock face you want to make sure you’ve used protection to catch you if you fall. Commits play a similar role: if you make a mistake, you can’t fall past the previous commit. Coding without commits is like free-climbing: you can travel much faster in the short-term, but in the long-term the chances of catastrophic failure are high! Like rock climbing protection, you want to be judicious in your use of commits. Committing too frequently will slow your progress; use more commits when you’re in uncertain or dangerous territory. Commits are also helpful to others, because they show your journey, not just the destination.\n\nfrom R Packages by Hadley Wickham\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ: “I forgot to close the quotation marks of my commit message! What do I do?”\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this situation, you command line probably looks like this:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\ngit commit -m \"Add filename.txt\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\nYou can try one of the following solutions:\n\nClose the quotation marks by entering another \".\nAbort the git commit command by typing Ctrl + C simultaneously and repeat it (now with quotation marks closed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4.2 Commit description\nAlthough it’s not required, it can be a good idea to add a more thorough description to the commit, in addition to the (shorter) commit message. While the commit message is usually a single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change, a more thorough description can be used to add more background information or helpful links that may help to understand the changes of the commit.\nTo add an additional description directly in the command line, add an extra -m after the commit message, followed by the description in quotes:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit commit -m \"Message\" -m \"Description\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon git commit flags\n\n\n\n\n\n-m : Specifies the commit message inline. For example, git commit -m \"Fix typo\" allows you to provide a short commit message directly in the command.\n-a or --all: Automatically stages all modified and deleted files before committing. This skips the separate git add step.\n-v or --verbose: Provides a detailed output, showing the diff of the changes being committed.\n-e or --edit: Opens the commit message editor, allowing you to edit the commit message before finalizing the commit.\n--amend: Modifies the previous commit. It allows you to add new changes to the previous commit or modify its commit message.",

It moves with each commit you make, staying always at the forefront of your project’s development. When you switch branches with a command like git switch, HEAD moves to point to the tip of the new branch, changing the context of your working directory to reflect the latest commit on that branch. HEAD is used in many Git commands to reference the current commit. For example, git reset HEAD is a command used to unstage changes by moving the current branch’s tip back to HEAD, without altering the working directory. Similarly, git checkout HEAD~1 will move HEAD back one commit as a way to look at or revert to a previous state of the project without making any changes to the branch itself.",

    "text": "6.3 Commit hashes\nTo compare the changes between two commits, you can use git diff followed by the commit hashes of the two points in history you’re interested in comparing. A commit hash is akin to a unique fingerprint for each commit you make to your repository. This hash is a long string of characters generated by Git using a cryptographic hash function (specifically SHA-1, though Git is transitioning to SHA-256 for enhanced security). The purpose of this hash is to uniquely identify every single change set or commit in the history of your repository. Think of it as a precise identifier that Git uses to track the specific state of your project at the moment of each commit. Every commit hash is unique. Even the slightest change results in a completely different hash.\n\n6.3.1 Good commits\nYou should not consider a commit as a general Save button, that you use to save all your recent changes in one go. Instead, each commit should ideally contain one isolated and complete change. For example, if you want to rename a variable and add a new enhancement, put the variable rename in one commit and the enhancement in another commit.\nThis approach to commits helps you down the line. For example, if you want to keep the enhancement but revert the renaming of the variable, you can revert the specific commit that contained the variable rename. If you put the variable rename and the enhancement in the same commit or spread the variable rename across multiple commits, you would spend more effort reverting your changes.",

It allows you to edit the commit message, add more changes to the commit, or simply adjust the last commit without creating a new commit. This flag can be useful if you forgot to include something in your last commit, made a typo or want to change your commit message. You can also combine --amend with other flags. To change the commit message of your last commit (without opening an editor) try:\n\n\n\nCode\n\n1git commit --amend -m \"changed commit message\"\n\n\n\n1\n\nReplace \"changed commit message\" with your actual improved commit message.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to to keep your commit message but include new changes to your file(s) in you last commit, you can use:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit commit --amend --no-edit\n\n\nThe --no-edit flag, lets you keep the commit message of your most recent commit.\n\n6.5.0.1 The repeated --amend workflow\nLet’s consider the following part of the rock climbing analogy for commits again:\n\nuse more commits when you’re in uncertain or dangerous territory.\n\nThe “repeated amend” is a Git workflow where you avoid cluttering your history with numerous tiny commits. Instead, you gradually build up a “good” commit by amending it repeatedly. Continue making small changes and amending the existing commit, refining it over time. This method keeps your Git history useful and looking good, making sure your commits tell a straightforward story of how your project evolved.\nThis workflow can be useful when you’re working on a new feature or a significant change and you might make several small adjustments to get it right. Instead of cluttering your history with numerous tiny commits for each tweak, you can use the “repeated amend” to gradually build up a well-polished commit that includes the entire feature.",

    "text": "6.7 What files can/should I track with Git?\nIn principle, any file can be tracked with Git. However, to make use of the full potential of Git, it is recommended to mainly track plain text files with Git.\n\n6.7.1 Code files\nTracking code files is the most common and original use case for version control with Git. Git is well-suited for tracking changes in source code, and it’s widely used by developers and teams for this purpose. Whether it’s a single developer maintaining a personal project or a large team collaborating on a complex software system, Git excels at tracking code files throughout the development lifecycle.\n\n\n6.7.2 Plain textfiles\nGit is a useful tool even if your project contains few or no code at all, especially in comparison to a setup that uses emails or shared Dropbox folders for “version control” (see the introduction chapter). However, to really be able to use the full set of features of Git, you should rely on plain text files for your project. This is because .docx files are saved as binary files, which makes meaningful outputs of the text inside it impossible for Git. “Plain textfiles” does not mean you have to use .txt files. Instead you can use formattable Markdown (.md) files. Markdown (.md) files are plain text files that contain formatting elements, making them more versatile than plain .txt files. Markdown allows you to add simple formatting like headings, lists, links, and images.\n\n\n6.7.3 Microsoft Office files\nAs said earlier, it is not recommended to track Microsoft office files using Git, since Git treats .docx files as binary files. Binary files lack the inherent structure that allows Git to capture and display changes effectively. Git relies on understanding the differences between versions of files. With binary files, you won’t benefit from the ability to view detailed textual differences (git diff) or effectively use branches. Collaborative work on binary files, such as simultaneous editing of a Word document, may result in complex merge conflicts that are challenging to resolve.\nSo while it is possible to track .docx files with Git, you will not be able to use the many features of Git, which rely on Git being able to display the file, since Git can only output the “zeros and ones” and not the text inside the .docx files.\nIf you ever choose to track them regardless, you should use detailed commit messages, since you will not be able to easily look at the text content of past versions. You will also need to know about temporary word files. For it’s own version control system, Word creates temporary files in the folder of your word file. You should not track these files using Git, since Word creates a lot of them. To not stage or commit these files by accident, you can use the .gitignore file.",

    "section": "6.8 Ignoring files and folders: .gitignore",
    "text": "6.8 Ignoring files and folders: .gitignore\n.gitignore is a special file. It is used to specify files and folders that should be ignored and not tracked by Git. When you create a .gitignore file, place it inside your Git repository and specify names of files or folders inside it. Git will then exclude these files and directories from being staged or committed, for example when using git add -A which normally stages all your files.\nThe .gitignore file is useful to prevent certain files or directories that are not essential for the project or generated during the development process from being included in the version history. Files that can recreated from the code, like for example .png plots from R code, should also be included in your project’s .gitignore file. Including only essential files in version control keeps your repository clean, making it easier for collaborators to focus on the important project files without distractions from unnecessary files. .gitignore can also help you avoid accidentally committing sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or personal data, which can lead to serious privacy breaches. Huge files, like big data files should also not be committed, since they can slow down working with your repository. To version control files with a big size, tools like DataLad are more appropriate.\nTo create a .gitignore file from the command line, navigate to your repository and use the touch command. Alternatively, create the file in your favorite text editor.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ntouch .gitignore\n\n\n.gitignore will be a hidden file, so to make it show up in the command line, you will have to use the -a flag in the ls command. For details on listing of files and folders, see the chapter on the command line.\n\n\n\nCode\n\nls -a\n\n\nNow you can write a filename or folder name inside it, to prevent Git from tracking it.\nIt’s recommended to add a project-specific .gitignore file to your repository using the regular stage-commit workflow that you learned about in this chapter, for example:\n\ngit add .gitignore\ngit commit -m \"Add .gitignore\"\n\n\n6.8.1 Global .gitignore file\nInstead of specifying files you want Git to ignore for each folder, you can also create global .gitignore file. To do this, you create a file named .gitignore_global (or any name you prefer) in your users’s home directory (located, for example, at /Users/yourusername). Then, you configure Git to use this global file by running:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global\n\n\nAfter this setup, you can add common files to this list, that you want to ignore. These rules will apply across to all Git repositories on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon wildcards\n\n\n\n\n\nAs discussed in the command line chapter wildcards are special characters that represent patterns of filenames or directory names. They can be used to specify multiple files or directories that should be ignored by Git when tracking changes. Wildcards allow you to match multiple files with a single rule, making it more convenient to exclude specific types of files or patterns.\n*: Matches any number of characters within a filename. For example, *.txt will match all files with the extension .txt in any directory.\n?: Matches a single character within a filename. For example, image?.png will match files like image1.png or imageA.png.\n/: Matches the root directory of the repository. For example, /config will match a directory named config only in the root of the repository.\n[] (Square Brackets): Matches any single character within the brackets. For example, file[123].txt will match file1.txt, file2.txt, or file3.txt.\n!: Negates a pattern and includes files that would otherwise be ignored. For example, !important.txt will exclude important.txt from being ignored, even if there’s a wildcard pattern that matches it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon files to ignore in scientific settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporary files and output: Ignore files generated during analysis, like log files, temporary files, or intermediate data files.\nData folders: Exclude large datasets or data stored locally.\nEnvironment-specific files: Exclude environment-specific files like .env files or venv folders used for local development setups.\nSystem-specific files: In macOS, ignore .DS_Store files, and in Windows, ignore Thumbs.db files.\nR: Ignore .Rdata files and /Rplots.pdf generated by R for plotting.\nPython: Ignore .pyc (Python compiled) files and pycache folders.\nLaTeX: Ignore auxiliary files like .aux, .log, .bbl, and .blg files generated during LaTeX compilation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample .gitignore file for an R project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# R-specific\n*.Rproj.user/\n*.Rhistory\n.RData\n.Rproj\n\n# R package specific\n.Rcheck/\nman/*.Rd\nNAMESPACE\n\n# Temporary files\n*.bak\n*.csv~\n*.html\n*.pdf\n\n# RMarkdown-specific\n*.knit.md\n*_cache/\n*_files/\n\n# R Markdown Notebook\n*.nb.html\n\n# RStudio Project Files\n*.Rproj\n\n# R Environment Variables\n.Renviron\n\n# R dcf file\nDESCRIPTION.meta\n\n# Mac-specific\n.DS_Store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the .DS_Store file (macOS only)?\n\n\n\n\n\n.DS_Store is a hidden file created by macOS in every folder to store custom attributes of the folder, such as the position of icons or the choice of a background image. The filename stands for “Desktop Services Store” and it helps macOS Finder maintain the folder’s view settings. .DS_Store is very commonly ignored from version control using the .gitignore file, for various reasons:\n\nUnnecessary for the project: .DS_Store files contain metadata that are only relevant to the local macOS file system and do not provide any useful information for the project itself. Including them in the repository adds unnecessary clutter.\nAvoiding conflicts: Since .DS_Store files are automatically generated by macOS, different users may have different versions of .DS_Store files based on their personal Finder settings. Should .DS_Store be tracked by Git, this can lead to unnecessary version conflicts when collaborating on a project.\nIrrelevant for collaborators with another operating system: Anyone else who is not using macOS (for example, Windows or Linux users) do not need these files and they serve no purpose for them. Including .DS_Store in the repository could confuse contributors who are not using macOS.\n\nTo add .DS_Store to .gitignore, you can include the following line in your .gitignore file:\n\n\n\nCode\n\n.DS_Store\n\n\nThis will ensure that any .DS_Store files in the project directory and its subdirectories are ignored by Git and not tracked in the repository.",

    "text": "6.9 Tracking empty folders\nNormally, Git does not track empty folders in a repository. However, tracking an empty directory in a Git repository can be useful in some scenarios. For example, you want to track an empty folder as a placeholder for future content or as a way to organize the project more clearly.\nA workaround, to get Git to track your empty folder, is adding a hidden .gitkeep file in this folder 1. This not an official Git feature but rather a convention adopted by software developers. That means you could name this file anything, but .gitkeep is used by convention to explicitly state its purpose for keeping otherwise empty folders in Git.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse-cases for empty folders in Git repositories for scientific projects\n\n\n\n\n\nAs discussed above, Git is not suitable for tracking a lot of large files, as is often the case when working with research data. Imagine that you use Git for your code that you use to analyze data from a research project. Usually, your analysis code needs access to the research data but you think that the research data is too large to be tracked with Git.\nHere is what you could do:\n\nCreate an empty subfolder in your analysis Git repo, called data.\nAdd a .gitkeep file to the /data folder and commit it.\nAdd the /data folder to your .gitignore file.\nAdd your research data to the /data folder.\n\nThis is the result: Your analysis code and research data can now live in the same repository. Your analysis code can access your research data in the /data folder. However, the contents of /data are not committed to the repository, thanks to the .gitignore file. If you later share that repository with collaborators, they will only receive a repository with an empty /data folder, thanks to .gitkeep. The advantage is that your collaborators can easily understand where to put the research data. Note, however, that you still need to make the research data accessible to your collaborators in another way.\nIf you are interested in version control of larger datasets, you can check out DataLad.",

    "text": "7.2 What are branches?\nBy default, every Git repository has one default branch, typically called main or master. Git branches are like separate versions or workspaces within the same Git repository. Branching allows to create a copy of a project and continue to make commits without integrating them into the default branch right away. Branches let you work on a parallel version of your repository’s contents without changing the content on your default branch (your main or master branch). You can visualize branches as shown in Figure 7.1.\nEach branch keeps its own history of changes, so you can develop things in parallel and merge changes between branches when you’re ready. Even if you are not happy with what you’ve developed on a branch, you can just delete or abandon the branch and continue with what you have on the default branch (see the “Feature B” branch in Figure 7.1). You can have as many branches as you want and also branch off from a branch that branched off from the default branch (see the “Feature A-1” branch in Figure 7.1).\nBranches are great for trying out new features, fixing bugs, or experimenting without causing chaos in the main development branch. Scientists might use branches to collaborate on research papers, exploring different parameters while running experiments or to test different data processing techniques or visualization approaches during data analysis. Git makes it easy to switch between branches and handle conflicts when merging. With branches, you can work independently and keep your code organized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Illustration of branches in a Git repository. Each circle represents a commit. Commits on the Main branch are shown in gray. The branch Feature A (blue circles) was created from the Main branch and later merged again. In-between, another branch Feature A-1 was created from the Feature A branch (green circles) and merged with that branch again before the Feature A branch was eventually merged with the Main branch. The branch Feature B was created but abandoned and not merged with the Main branch.

What is going on?\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you can switch branches for the first time, you need to have made at least one commit on your current branch (for example, on the main branch). This requirement ensures that there’s a baseline history in your repository, allowing Git to manage changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more: What is the difference between git checkout and git switch?\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to Git version 2.23, the git checkout command was the primary way to switch branches. It allows you to move to a different branch and update your working directory to reflect the state of that branch. In Git 2.23 and later versions, the git switch command was introduced as a safer and more intuitive alternative to git checkout. It simplifies the branch-switching process and provides clearer feedback in case of errors.\ngit checkout is a versatile and powerful command that, among other things, was traditionally used for switching branches. However, it has other use cases like checking out specific files or commits. It can be used for branch switching, but it may have some ambiguity in its syntax, especially when used for other purposes.\n\n\n\n\n7.5.1 Switching branches with uncommitted changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section references more advanced Git commands. If you’re facing the issue that Git prevents you from switching branches, read on. If you’re just learning about branches and switching branches worked without any problems, feel free to skip this section for now.\n\n\n\nWhen you have uncommitted changes in your working directory that do not conflict with the branch you’re switching to, Git allows you to switch branches without losing those changes. Your uncommitted changes are effectively brought over to the new branch. This feature can be particularly useful when you’ve started making changes and then realize you’re on the wrong branch or need to move your work to a different context.\nGit is designed to prevent you from switching branches if there’s a risk of overwriting your changes. This means that Git will not allow you to switch branches if your uncommitted changes would cause conflicts with the branch you’re attempting to switch to. If you try to switch branches with uncommitted changes you will get an error message similar to:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nerror: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:\n        example.txt\nPlease commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.\nAborting\n\n\nThe message specifies the file with modifications (here, example.txt), and indicates an aborted branch switch due to uncommitted changes. To resolve this and switch branches safely, you have a few options:\n\nCommit your changes: Use the stage and commit process to save your work on the current branch. This involves staging your changes with git add and then committing them with git commit. This workflow is explained in detail in the chapter on basic Git commands.\nStash your changes: If you’re not ready to commit, you can use git stash to temporarily shelve your changes. This clears your working directory, allowing you to switch branches. Your stashed changes can be reapplied later. Stashing is covered in more detail in the section below.\nDiscard your changes: If the changes are not needed, you can remove them using git reset to unstage all changes. This action should be used with caution as it will erase your modifications. This command is covered in the chapter “Rewriting history”.",

    "text": "7.6 Merging branches\nAfter you’ve worked on a branch for some time and you completed work on the feature that you wanted to implement, you might want to incorporate your work into the main branch (or any other target branch). You can do this using the git merge command. To do this, switch to your main branch (using git switch or git checkout) and then use:\n\n\n\nCode\n\n1git merge feature\n\n\n\n1\n\nReplace feature with the name of your branch, if needed.\n\n\n\n\nNote, that your current branch (the branch that you are “on”) should be the one that you want to merge changes into from another branch. For example, if you want to merge changes into the main branch from the feature branch, you need to be on main and then merge the feature branch.\nIf you have not yet made any changes on the feature branch you should get the following output:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nAlready up to date.\n\n\nThis output indicates that the branch you are trying to merge is already fully incorporated into the branch you are currently on. In other words, there are no new changes in the feature branch that need to be merged because your current branch already contains all the changes from the feature branch.\nIf you have changed file(s) in your folder and committed them on the feature branch, you’ll likely get an output similar to:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nUpdating 555ba0c..994bb8d\nFast-forward\n \n example.txt    |   4 ++++\n\n 1 file changed\n\n\nThe output reveals a “fast-forward” merge operation, where changes from commit 555ba0c to 994bb8d are incorporated. The common starting point of the two branches is commit 555ba0c and commit 994bb8d marks the latest commit in the merged branch. A “fast-forward” merge, the simplest form of merges, updates your position to the latest changes without creating a new commit. In this example, the merge modified only one file, the example.txt file, introducing four new lines denoted by 4 ++++.

    "section": "7.7 Merge conflicts",
    "text": "7.7 Merge conflicts\nMerge conflicts occur when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences between two branches during a merge. This happens when both branches include conflicting changes to the same part of a file. Git simply can’t determine which version of the code should be favored, and as a result, it requests manual intervention from you, the developer. It’s similar to when two people try to edit the same part of a file at the same time, and Git gets confused about whose changes to keep. Merge conflicts are more likely to occur in collaborative projects, where multiple people modify the same files. However, they can also happen in projects where you work on your own.\n\n7.7.1 Avoiding merge conflicts\nMerge conflicts can be a bit of a headache. If you only work locally on your computer, without a remote repository (for example, an online version of your repository on GitHub or GitLab), you can avoid merge conflicts easier because you are less likely to edit the same part of the same file on different branches. However, once you start to collaborate with others, it may not be possible to entirely avoid merge conflicts. That being said, employing good development practices can minimize the occurrence of merge conflicts. Regularly pulling changes from the remote repository into your local branch (using git pull) and keeping your branch up-to-date can help identify and resolve conflicts early. You will learn more about how to effectively manage collaborative work on Git repositories in the following chapters on remote repositories.\n\n\n7.7.2 Example merge conflict\nLet’s look at an example merge conflict. You can recreate this example yourself by following the instructions below.\n\nCreate a new file, for example called example.txt.\nCreate and switch to a new branch, for example called feature.\nAdd some text to the first line of the example.txt file, for example Git is super.\nAdd and commit your changes on the feature branch.\nSwitch back to your main branch.\nAdd some text to the first line of the example.txt file, for example Git is cool. Note that example.txt should be empty because the previous text was added on the feature branch, not on the main branch.\nAdd and commit your changes on the main branch.\nMerge the changes on the feature branch into the main branch: git merge feature.\nCongrats, you create a merge conflict!\n\n\n\n7.7.3 Understanding merge conflicts\nWhen a merge conflict arises, you should not view it as a limitation of Git but rather as a helpful feature. If you try to merge branches with conflicting changes in a file the output looks similar to this:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nAuto-merging example.txt\nCONFLICT: Merge conflict in example.txt\nAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\n\n\nDuring a merge conflict, you can run git status to see which files are in conflict:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nOn branch main\nYou have unmerged paths.\n  (fix conflicts and run \"git commit\")\n  (use \"git merge --abort\" to abort the merge)\n\nUnmerged paths:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to mark resolution)\n    both modified:   example.txt\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\n\nGit will highlight the conflicting parts in the affected file(s), and you must choose the desired changes or modify them to create a consistent version. To do this, open up the file(s) with conflicts in a text editor of your choice, and you’ll see the conflicting sections marked with the following indicators:\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n=======\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nIn our example, this will look like this:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\nGit is cool\n=======\nGit is super\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feature\n\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; indicates the beginning of lines that encountered a merge conflict. The initial lines are from the file where you were attempting to merge the changes (in this case, the changes on the main branch). The lines between &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD and ======= represent the changes that were made in your current branch (here, the main branch). ======= shows the break point for comparison. It divides the changes the user has committed (above) from the changes brought in from the merge (below) for visual comparison. The section between ======= and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; represents the changes from the branch you are trying to merge into your current branch (here, the feature branch). &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shows the end of the lines with a merge conflict.\n\n\n7.7.4 Resolving merge conflicts\nTo resolve the merge conflict, you need to manually edit the conflicting sections to the desired state, removing the conflict markers. You might want to keep some changes from your current branch, some from the merged branch, keep only the changes from one branch, or make entirely new changes. After editing the file it might look something like this:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nGit is super cool!\n\n\nIn this example, the conflict has been resolved by mixing both sets of changes. Parts of the changes from both branches are now present in the file. If you are done you can use git add to stage the resolved changes:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit add example.txt\n\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved, proceed with the commit, for example:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit commit -m \"Resolve merge conflict\"\n\n\nYour branches should now be merged and your conflict resolved.\nBefore you try to fix more complex merge conflicts, make sure you understand the changes that don’t match up to avoid making things more complicated. Resolving conflicts can be tricky, especially when merging branches with many differences. But remember that your old versions are safe, so you can fix the issue without affecting them.\n\n\n7.7.5 Aborting a merge\nIf you feel like you are stuck in the merge process and want to get back to the state of the branch before you started the merge process, you can also abort the merge using:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit merge --abort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon git merge flags\n\n\n\n\n\n--abort: Abort the current merge operation and reset the branch to its pre-merge state.\n--continue: Continue the merge process after resolving conflicts.\n--log: Include the log message from the commit(s) being merged in the new merge commit.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.7.6 Types of merges\nGit supports different types of merges to support various situations in software development. Each merge type has its purpose and advantages, allowing developers to choose the most suitable approach based on their specific project needs and workflow.\n\n7.7.6.1 Standard merge\nIn a standard merge, Git takes each commit from the merged branch and adds them to the history of the base branch (the branch you are currently on) with their original time stamps. It creates a new “merge commit”, a special record that marks when the merge happened, showing that the branches are now combined. To perform a standard merge, use the following command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit merge \n\n\n\n\n7.7.6.2 Fast-forward merge\nIf no new commits were made to the base branch since the feature was created, Git automatically does a “Fast Forward Merge”. It’s like the standard merge, but no new merge commit is created. It’s as if you made the commits directly on the base branch. Since the base branch remained unchanged, there’s no need to mark a separate merge in the history. You can ensure a fast-forward merge by using the --ff-only flag:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit merge --ff-only\n\n\nIf you do not want a fast-forward merge, you can ensure a merge commit with the --no-ff flag.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit merge --no-ff\n\n\n\n\n7.7.6.3 Squash and merge\nWhen you squash a branch, Git combines all commits of the branch into a single commit. This new commit is then added to the history, but the individual commits that were part of the branch are not retained or preserved separately. Instead, the squashed commit represents the collective changes made in the branch, creating a cleaner and more concise history.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit merge --squash\n\n\nSquashing commits can be desirable in a situation where you don’t want others to see the history of individual commits made on the feature branch. For example, imagine writing the draft of a paper and you’ve made a couple of changes in the early phase of writing the draft that you consider silly and you only want your collaborators to see the final draft version. In this situation, you could squash all previous commits and only merge the latest version of your draft.",

    "text": "7.9 Best practices\n\n7.9.1 Keep the main branch clean\nThe central purpose of branches is to keep the main branch clean. In practice, this means that you should regularly work on separate branches and only integrate new changes into the main branch when they are ready. The main branch should only contain work that is complete and rightfully belongs in the main version of your project. For example, if you use Git to track changes in code (like analysis scripts) you should make sure that the version of the code on the main branch always works, i.e., can be executed without errors. Any addition to your analysis code would be developed on a separate branch and only integrated with the main branch if the code can be executed without errors.\n\n\n7.9.2 Name branches consistently\nAdopt a consistent naming convention for branches that accurately reflects their purpose. This can include prefixes like feature/, bug/, followed by a descriptive name. Clear and standardized branch names make it easier to identify the purpose of each branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 7.1: Find out more: Naming conventions for Git branches\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic recommendations for branch names\n\nLowercase and hyphen-separated: Use lowercase letters for your branch names and hyphens to separate words. For example: feature/new-login or bugfix/header-styling.\nAlphanumeric characters: Limit branch names to alphanumeric characters (a-z, 0-9) and hyphens, avoiding punctuation, spaces, underscores, or other non-alphanumeric characters.\nNo continuous hyphens: Avoid using continuous hyphens in branch names, as in feature--new-login, which can be confusing.\nNo trailing hyphens: Refrain from ending branch names with a hyphen, as in feature-new-login-.\nDescriptive: Choose descriptive and concise names that reflect the focus of the work carried out on the branch.\n\nBranch prefixes\nUsing prefixes in branch names helps to quickly identify the purpose of a branch. Below are two common branch types with their corresponding prefixes:\n\nFeature Branches: These branches are used for developing new features. Use the prefix feature, for example: feature/new-analysis.\nBugfix Branches: These branches are used to fix bugs (errors or problems with the code). Use the prefix bugfix, for example: bugfix/fix-typo.\n\nFor more recommendations on branch naming conventions, see for example Amin (2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n7.9.3 Keep branches specific and short-lived\nCreate branches with a specific goal or task in mind, and aim to keep them short-lived. As for your main branch, you should try to keep individual branches clean by focusing on adding one new feature per branch. This approach ensures that completed features can be merged into the main branch independently of those that are still in progress. Long-lived branches can lead to conflicts and make it harder to merge changes. Once the task is complete or the feature is integrated, consider deleting the branch.\n\n\n7.9.4 Avoiding merge conflicts\nThe best way to deal with merge conflicts, is to try and avoid them in the first place. You can reduce the chances of conflicts by keeping branches tidy, concentrating on one task, and involving fewer files. In addition, it’s good practice to merge each other’s changes into your work frequently. Before merging, understand the content in both branches. If multiple people have worked on the same branches, open communication and good project management can also help to stay informed about each other’s changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section concludes the most important Git commands for working with branches for new learners. The following sections will dive into more advanced Git commands that become relevant once you start using branches more extensively.

    "title": "7  Branches",
    "section": "7.10 Stashing",
    "text": "7.10 Stashing\ngit stash is a valuable command in Git that allows you to save your current changes temporarily without committing them. This is useful when you need to switch branches or work on something else without creating a commit for unfinished work. For example, when you’re working on a feature and you need to switch to a different task quickly or your work gets interrupted unexpectedly, you may not want to commit your unfinished changes. When you run git stash, Git stores the changes in your working directory and staged changes in a special stash commit. The working directory is then reverted to the last committed state, providing a clean slate for your next task.\n\n7.10.1 Stashing changes\nTo demonstrate the usefulness of git stash, you can edit one or more files in your repository, stage (or don’t stage) your changes, but don’t commit them. Now use git status to look at the current state of your working directory.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit status\n\n\nYou should get an output similar to:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n\n    modified:   example.html\n\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\n    modified:   example.txt   \n\n\nIn this example, there are changes on two tracked files, one staged and one not staged, that we want to stash. Just like when committing, it is possible to add a message when stashing using the -m flag. It makes sense to add a message because it serves as a reminder of what changes were stashed, making it easier to identify the purpose of the stash when you later list or apply stashes.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit stash -m \"feature X WIP\"\n\n\nYou should get an output similar to:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nSaved working directory and index state On feature: \"feature X WIP\"\n\n\nYou can now use git status to look at your working directory again and should see an output similar to:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nOn branch main\nnothing to commit, working directory clean\n\n\nNow you can switch branches and work on something else or stop working on the project altogether.\n\n\n7.10.2 Retrieving stashed changes\nTo look at all your stored stashes, you can use git stash list:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit stash list\n\n\nYou should get an output similar to:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nstash@{0}: On feature: feature X WIP\n\n\nAll of your stored stashes should show up, with the most recent on top. Every stash should have a number, applied chronologically.\n\n\n7.10.3 Applying stashed changes\nIf you want to reapply your stashed changes, you can use git stash apply. This command automatically applies your latest stash. You can also specify a stored stash, for example git stash apply stash@{0}\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit stash apply stash@{0}\n\n\nYou should get an output similar to:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nOn branch main\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;.. .\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\n    modified:   example.html\n    modified:   example.txt\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\n\nThe changes made in your stored stashed are now applied again in your working directory. Note that already staged files are not automatically staged again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon git stash flags\n\n\n\n\n\ngit stash -m \"message\": Save your changes in a stash with a message.\ngit stash apply stash@{n}: Apply the changes from the specified stash (identified by its index n) to your working directory.\ngit stash pop stash@{n}: Apply the changes from the specified stash (identified by its index n) to your working directory and remove the stash from the stash list.\ngit stash list: List all the stashes you have created, showing their reference numbers and stash messages.\ngit stash drop stash@{n}: Remove the specified stash (identified by its index n) from the stash list.\ngit stash branch &lt;branchname&gt;: Create a new branch named &lt;branchname&gt; from the commit where you originally stashed your changes and apply the stash to the new branch.\ngit stash show stash@{n}: Show the diff of the changes stored in the specified stash (identified by its index n).",

This means, you can pick and apply specific commits to your current branch without merging the entire branch. This can be useful when you only want to bring in specific changes from another branch into your current branch, in contrast to merging all commits of a branch, as visualized in Figure 7.2. You will need the hash of the commit you want to “cherry-pick” and then use the command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit cherry-pick &lt;commithash&gt;\n\n\nAgain, you might have to resolve merge conflicts. The default commit message will be:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nCherry-pick commit &lt;commit-hash&gt;\nThis commit was cherry-picked from &lt;source-branch&gt; at &lt;source-commit-hash&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Image from Blogpost “What IS git cherry-pick?” by 0xkoji\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon git cherry-pick flags\n\n\n\n\n\n-n or --no commit: Prevents Git from automatically creating a new commit after cherry-picking. It stages the changes, allowing you to make additional modifications or review them before committing.\n-e or --edit: Opens the default text editor to edit the commit message of the new cherry-picked commit. Useful when you want to provide a custom message for the cherry-picked commit.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.11.2 Rebasing\ngit rebase is a different way compared to a standard merge to integrate changes from one branch into another. For example, when you rebase the feature branch onto the main branch you “rearrange” the commits. It’s like taking your changes, applying them on top of the latest main branch, and making it all look like a smooth line. The new commits you made in the feature branch are still there, but they appear as if they were created after the latest changes in the main branch. It’s like picking up your changes and placing them on the latest code, resulting in a linear history. For an illustration, see Figure 7.3.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit rebase main\n\n\nHowever, you should use rebase with caution when collaborating with others, as it can rewrite commit history and create conflicts for team members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Image from Blogpost “Deep dive into Git Rebase” by Mohan Murali\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon git rebase flags\n\n\n\n\n\n--interactive or -i: Start an interactive rebase, allowing you to edit, reorder, or squash commits interactively.\n--continue: Continue the rebase after resolving conflicts or editing commits during an interactive rebase.\n--abort: Abort the current rebase operation and return the branch to its original state before the rebase.\n--skip: Skip the current commit during an interactive rebase.\n-p or --preserve-merges: Preserve merge commits during the rebase.\n--autosquash: Automatically squash commits marked with “squash” or “fixup” in their commit message during an interactive rebase.",

    "text": "8.1 What are remote repositories?\nA remote repository is a version of your Git repository that is hosted on a server, usually on the internet. Unlike your local repository, which is on your personal computer, a remote repository can be a shared resource that allows multiple contributors to collaborate on a project. These remote repositories could be hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Codeberg or a private server. In this chapter, we will mainly focus on the repository hosting platforms GitHub, mainly because it is the most popular platform for Git repositories with 100 million users (as of January 2023, according to Wikipedia) and GitLab, since it is a very popular alternative and offered by many academic institutions.",

    "text": "8.1.1 Why use remote repositories?\nOne of the main reasons to use remote repositories is for collaboration. If your Git repository only exists on your computer, no one else can access it. Remote repositories provide a central location where team members can collectively work on a project. Whether contributors are across the room or across the globe, remote repositories make it possible for everyone to access the same set of project files and contribute to the development process.\nHosting a project on a remote repository also serves as a backup mechanism. If a contributor’s computer fails or their files get corrupted, they can always download (or “clone”) a fresh copy of the project from the remote repository. This ensures that the project’s progress is not dependent on a single person’s computer. Figure 8.1 jokingly illustrates this point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: “In case of fire” by Louis-Michel Couture (License: MIT; Source on GitHub)",

    "text": "8.3 Connecting to a remote repository hosting service\n\n8.3.1 Authentication\nIn order to connect your local Git repository with a remote repository, you need to establish an authentication method. Depending on the platform there are different authentication methods available. We introduce the most common authentication methods below, separately for each platform.\n\n8.3.1.1 Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)\nThe Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution. For more details on SSH, see Wikipedia.\nYou can read and write data in remote repositories like GitHub and GitLab using SSH. When you connect with SSH, you verify your identity using a private key file stored on your computer. We provide basic instructions below. For more detailed instructions, see the GitHub Documentation.\n\n GitHub MPIB GitLab\n\n\n\nConnecting to GitHub\nGitHub authentication is needed to access and work with repositories that are stored on GitHub. It is kind of like showing your ID to prove who you are before entering a restricted area. It’s necessary to make sure only the right people or programs can access and do things on GitHub, keeping everything safe and organized.\nFor security reasons it is no longer possible to authenticate yourself using only your GitHub email and password. There are multiple authentication methods which offer different advantages and drawbacks. In this section, we will briefly introduce one of the two most common authentication methods: Personal Access Tokens.\nIf you would rather use the SSH protocol for authentication, check out the SSH documentation.\n\n\nPersonal Access Token (PAT)\nFollow these steps to set a Personal Access Token (PAT; see Figure 8.2):\n\nLog in to your GitHub account on GitHub.com\nClick on your profile picture in the top-right corner and select “Settings”.\nIn the left sidebar, select “Developer settings”, then “Personal access tokens (classic)”.\nClick “Generate new token”.\nGive your token a name. The name should help you to later identify in which context you used the token. For example, you could add a short description of the machine that you generated the token for, for example MacBook Pro 14-inch, 2021.\nChoose the desired scopes. The scopes define the permissions of the token, or “what it is allowed to do” with your GitHub account and repositories. For a normal use case, you should enable the scopes repo, admin:org and delete_repo for a full access.\nSet an expiration date if needed. You can also choose “No expiration”.\nClick “Generate token,” and you’ll be presented with your new token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to copy the PAT as it won’t be shown again!\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to copy the Personal Access Token (PAT) as it won’t be shown again! The first time you try to interact with a remote repository, you will get asked for a password. Paste the PAT as the password into the terminal to proceed.\nIf you use Git Bash on Windows, your terminal will open a window where you can choose to authenticate yourself with a PAT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ: My PAT is not shown when I enter it into the terminal?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen authenticating with GitHub on macOS, you may notice that the password doesn’t show up in the command line as you type it. This is normal behavior to ensure security. You can still enter your password (or delete what you typed) even though it doesn’t appear on the screen. You can also copy and paste text, for example your PAT from GitHub. When authenticating on Windows, a new window might pop up in which you can enter your PAT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Screenshot of the personal access token settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more: More details about PAT settings\n\n\n\n\n\nExpiration Date:\nWhen you create a Personal Access Token, you can specify its expiration date. The expiration date is the date and time when the token becomes invalid and cannot be used for authentication anymore. Setting an expiration date is a security measure to limit the time during which the token can be misused if it falls into the wrong hands. Creating an expiration date for a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) is not strictly necessary, but it is considered a good security practice.\nScopes:\nWhen you create a PAT, you can choose the scopes to define what actions the token is allowed to perform. These scopes determine the level of access the token has to different parts of your GitHub account or repositories.\nHere are some common scopes you might encounter when creating a GitHub PAT:\nrepo: This scope provides full control of private and public repositories, including the ability to read, write, and delete code.\nrepo:status: Grants access to commit statuses, allowing the token to read and set commit status for a repository.\nrepo_deployment: Enables the token to access deployment-related events and perform actions related to repository deployments.\nread:org: Allows the token to read organization membership, teams, and repositories within an organization.\nuser: Grants access to user-related data, including user profile information.\ndelete_repo: Provides permission to delete repositories.\nadmin:org: Offers administrative access to the entire organization, including managing teams and repositories.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecure Shell Protocol (SSH)\n\n8.3.1.2 Generating a new SSH key\n\nOpen the Terminal.\nInsert the text below, changing the example email to your email address:\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n\n\nThis will result into an output similar to this:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nGenerating public/private ed25519 key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/Users/user/.ssh/id_ed25519): \n\n\n\nWhen asked to “Enter a file in which to save the key,” you can just press Enter to use the default location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSH key already exists?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the SSH key already exists, you will get an output similar to this:\n\n\n\nCode\n\n/Users/user/.ssh/id_ed25519 already exists.\nOverwrite (y/n)? n\n\n\nIf you don’t want to overwrite the existing key, type n and hit Enter. You can now use the existing key and move on with the next step.\n\n\n\n\nWhen prompted, enter a secure passphrase.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]\nEnter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I have to provide a password for my SSH key?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf someone gets into your computer, they can use your SSH keys to access all systems that use those keys. Adding a passphrase to your SSH key makes it more secure. To avoid typing the passphrase each time you connect, you can securely store it in an SSH agent. For more details, see the GitHub documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.1.3 Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account\n\nCopy the SSH public key to your clipboard. The following command will copy the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file to your clipboard.\n\n\n macOS Windows Linux\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\npbcopy &lt; ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n\n\nIf the pbcopy command isn’t working, find the hidden .ssh folder in your home directory, open the id_ed25519.pub file in your favorite text editor, and copy the contents to your clipboard.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nclip &lt; ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n\n\nIf the clip command isn’t working, find the hidden .ssh folder in your home directory, open the id_ed25519.pub file in your favorite text editor, and copy the contents to your clipboard.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\ncat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n\n\nThen select and copy the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file displayed in the terminal to your clipboard.\nAlternatively, find the hidden .ssh folder in your home directory, open the id_ed25519.pub file in your favorite text editor, and copy the contents to your clipboard.\n\n\n\n\nIn the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click Settings.\nIn the “Access” section of the sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys.\nClick New SSH key or Add SSH key.\nIn the “Title” field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example, if you’re using a personal laptop, you might call it “Personal laptop”.\nChoose the type of key, either authentication or signing. Usually, you want to select “authentication” here.\nIn the “Key” field, paste your public key.\nClick Add SSH key.\nIf prompted, confirm access to your GitHub account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecure Shell Protocol (SSH)\n\nGenerating a new SSH key\n\nOpen the Terminal.\nInsert the text below, changing the example email to your MPIB email address (or the email address that you use for MPIB GitLab):\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n\n\nThis will result into an output similar to this:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nGenerating public/private ed25519 key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/Users/user/.ssh/id_ed25519): \n\n\n\nWhen asked to “Enter a file in which to save the key,” you can just press Enter to use the default location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSH key already exists?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the SSH key already exists, you will get an output similar to this:\n\n\n\nCode\n\n/Users/user/.ssh/id_ed25519 already exists.\nOverwrite (y/n)? n\n\n\nIf you don’t want to overwrite the existing key, type n and hit Enter.

    "section": "8.4 Creating a remote repository",
    "text": "8.4 Creating a remote repository\n\n GitHub GitLab\n\n\nTo create a new repository on GitHub, click on the “+” sign in the top-right corner of the GitHub page. From the drop down menu, select “New repository”. On the new repository page, you are asked to enter some details about your repository and select a few options (see Figure 8.3):\n\nOn the new repository page, as shown in enter a name for your repository. If you are planning to upload a local repository (a repository on your computer) to GitHub, it makes sense to choose the same name as on your computer. Also, we recommend to avoid white spaces and use hyphens (-) or underscores (_) to separate words in your repository name.\nYou can also add an additional (optional) description to provide more details about the content of your repository. The description will be shown on the main page of your GitHub repository and can help other users to understand the purpose of your repository.\nNext, you can choose to make the repository public or private. A public repository can be viewed by anyone worldwide even if they don’t have a GitHub account. It’s like a public website on the internet. A private repository can only be viewed by you and any collaborators that you specifically invite to your repository. For more details about public vs. private repositories, see the box below.\nAt last, you can choose to initialize your repository with a few files, specifically a README file (find out more in the next chapter), a template .gitignore file (see the chapter on “First steps with Git”), or a license file.\nFinally, click the green “Create repository” button at the bottom of the page to create a new repository with these settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more: Public or private repository?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create a new repository on GitHub, you can control who can see it by choosing if it’s public or private.\nIf it’s public, anyone on the internet can access it. If it’s private, only you, the people you specifically allow, and, for organization repositories, certain members can access it. For further details, see the chapter “About repository visibility” in the GitHub documentation.\nIf you have admin permissions for a repository, you can change its visibility. This means you can later still make a public repository private and private repository public, if needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Screenshot of creating a new repository\n\n\n\n\n8.4.0.1 Repository settings\nTo access the settings of a GitHub repository, go to the main page of the GitHub repository you want to configure and look for the “Settings” tab, usually located towards the right side of the repository’s navigation bar. Once you’re on the repository settings page, you’ll find various sections on the left sidebar that allow you to configure different aspects of the repository, such as “General,” “Branches,” or “Collaborators”.\nIn the “General” section you can, for example, rename your repository or default branch, change the repositories visibility or delete your repository. For a detailed guide on the repository settings, you can check out the GitHub documentation.\n\n\n8.4.0.2 Adding collaborators\nIn the “Collaborators” tab of the settings, it is possible to add accounts which can view or add changes your repository, even if it is private by entering their GitHub username or email address.\n\n\n\nCreating a new repository in GitLab is quite similar to GitHub. GitLab calls repositories mostly projects, but you can use these terms interchangeably. After logging into your GitLab account, you need to follow these steps:\n\nCreate new project\nClick on the New Project button, usually found in the dashboard. Here you can choose to create a blank project. Alternatively you can also create one from template or import a project.\n\n\nFill in project details\nNext, fill in project details: If you create a blank project you will have to fill in the following details.\n\nProject Name: Enter a name for your project. Avoid spaces and use hyphens (-) or underscores (_) instead.\nProject Slug: This is the end of the URL of your project. It will be auto-filled based on your project name, but you can edit it. It should be URL-friendly. We recommend to use your project name to avoid confusion.\nDescription (Optional): Add a description to explain the purpose of your project.\nVisibility Level: Choose the visibility of your project:\n\nPublic: Accessible by anyone (worldwide).\nInternal: Accessible by any logged-in user. At institutional instances, this means everyone at your institute can see your repository.\nPrivate: Accessible only by you and invited collaborators.\n\n\n\n\nInitialize the repository\nLike on GitHub, you can choose to initialize the repository with a README file, a .gitignore template, and a license file. If you plan to push an existing local repository, do not initialize with a README or other files to avoid conflicts.\n\n\nCreate the project\nClick the “Create project” button to create your new repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t initialize a remote repository with any files, if you want to upload a local repository!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to upload your local repository to an remote repository, make sure that you create the repository without initializing it with a README file or any other files. Initializing the repository with a README or any other files creates a commit in the repository. When you try to push your local repository, you will encounter conflicts because the histories of your local and remote repositories will differ.\nTo avoid this, create the remote repository empty. You can add a README.md and other files after pushing your local repository.",

    "text": "8.5 Adding a remote to your local repository\nLet’s assume that you have a local Git repository on your computer that you want to upload to a remote repository hosting service. To initialize an existing repository as a remote repository, you first need to create a new repository on your chosen hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), as explained above.\nTo add a remote repository to your local Git repository, navigate to your repository using the command line 1 and use the git remote command:\n\n GitHub MPIB GitLab\n\n\n\n\n\nCode (HTTPS)\n\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/user-name/repo-name.git\n\n\n\n\n\nCode (SSH)\n\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:user-name/repo-name.git\n\n\nReplace user-name with the repository’s user name and repo-name with the name of the repository.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode (HTTPS)\n\ngit remote add origin https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/user-name/repo-name.git\n\n\n\n\n\nCode (SSH)\n\ngit remote add origin git@git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de:user-name/repo-name.git\n\n\nReplace user-name with the repository’s user name and repo-name with the name of the repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTTPS vs. SSH: Different remote URL!\n\n\n\n\n\nNote, that depending on whether you are connecting to the remote repository via HTTPS or SSH, you have to use a different URL for your remote repository!\n\n\n\nReplace &lt;remote-repository-URL&gt; with the URL of your remote repository (HTTPS or SSH). This command is essentially telling Git: “Add a remote repository named origin with the specified location (URL).” After running this command, your local Git repository will be aware of the remote repository, and you can synchronize changes between your local repository and the remote repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is origin?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term “origin” is a conventionally used name for the default remote repository. It’s a standard name and we recommend using it, but you could also choose another name if you prefer. For example, if you are connecting to GitHub, you could also replace origin with github Specifying different names for the remote repository is useful (or even necessary) when you are configuring multiple remote repositories.\n\n\n\n\n8.5.1 Checking configured remotes\nIf you want to check which remotes are configured for a local repository, run the following command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit remote -v\n\n\nBelow is an example output, in this case for the Git repository for this book. This output basically tells you that one remote called origin is configured, it shows the URL for the remote repository on GitHub, and indicated that this remote is used both to fetch changes from and push changes to GitHub.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\norigin  git@github.com:lnnrtwttkhn/version-control-book.git (fetch)\norigin  git@github.com:lnnrtwttkhn/version-control-book.git (push)\n\n\nYou can tell from the URL that in this case the remote was configured using SHH.\n\n\n8.5.2 Editing the remote URL\nIf you need to change the URL of an existing remote repository, you have two options: removing the remote and re-adding it, or setting a new URL directly.\n\n8.5.2.1 Remove and re-add the remote\n\nRemove the existing remote (assuming that it’s called origin):\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit remote rm origin\n\n\n\nAdd the remote again with a different URL:\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit remote add origin &lt;remote-repository-URL&gt;\n\n\n\n\n8.5.2.2 Set a new URL\nYou can also directly update the URL:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit remote set-url origin &lt;remote-repository-URL&gt;\n\n\nThere is no feedback following this command. To check if the new URL was set as expected, you can enter git remote -v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more: Common git remote commands\n\n\n\n\n\ngit remote: Lists all remote repositories associated with the current local repository.\ngit remote -v: Lists remote repositories along with their URLs.\ngit remote add &lt;name&gt; &lt;url&gt;: Adds a new remote repository with the specified name and URL.\ngit remote rm &lt;name&gt;: Removes the remote repository with the specified name.\ngit remote rename &lt;old-name&gt; &lt;new-name&gt;: Renames a remote repository from old-name to new-name.\ngit remote set-url &lt;name&gt; &lt;url&gt;: Update the URL of the remote to a new repository URL.",

    "text": "8.6 Pushing\nAfter you added a remote to your local repository, you are now able to “upload” your files to the remote repository using the command git push. This command is used to “upload” your local commits to the remote repository. When you run git push, Git examines your local branch and its commits, and then pushes those commits to the corresponding branch on the remote repository.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit push -u origin main\n\n\nThe command above “uploads” the local branch named “main” to a remote repository called “origin” while setting it as the upstream branch. -u is used to set the upstream branch. It tells Git to remember the remote branch to which your local branch should be uploaded in the future. After a successful push, you will get a message like this:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nEnumerating objects: 17, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (17/17), done.\nDelta compression using up to 8 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (12/12), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (12/12), 2.11 KiB | 2.11 MiB/s, done.\nTotal 12 (delta 9), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nremote: Resolving deltas: 100% (9/9), completed with 5 local objects.\nTo https://github.com/username/repository.git\n   fb3efef..8f50685  main -&gt; main\n\n\nThe git push operation involves enumerating, compressing, and writing objects to the remote repository. The output indicates the progress of these steps, including delta compression, and concludes with a summary of the pushed branch and commit range. In this specific example, changes from the local main branch (commit fb3efef) were pushed to the remote main branch (commit 8f50685).\nIt’s important to note that you need appropriate access and permissions to push to a remote repository. If you do not have write access, you won’t be able to push your changes. If you do not specify a branch and just run git push, Git will push the one “you are on” in the moment.\nGit will verify if your local branch is up to date with the remote branch. If there are new commits on the remote branch that you don’t have locally, Git may reject the push and ask you to first pull the latest changes and merge them into your local branch to prevent overwriting or conflicts (find out more about pulling below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon git push flags\n\n\n\n\n\n-u or --set-upstream: This flag is used to set the upstream branch for the current branch. It is typically used when pushing a branch for the first time to link the local branch with a remote branch.\n--force or -f: Force pushes the local main branch to the origin remote repository, overwriting any changes that may have been made to the main branch in the remote repository.\n--all: This flag pushes all branches to the remote repository.\n--dry-run: This flag simulates the push operation without actually pushing any data to the remote repository. It’s useful for checking what would be pushed.\nlocal_branch:remote_branch: This syntax allows you to push a specific local branch to a specific remote branch. Example: git push origin my_local_branch:my_remote_branch",

    "section": "8.7 Cloning",
    "text": "8.7 Cloning\nCloning refers to creating a local copy of a repository from a remote hosting service on your computer. When you clone a repository, you download all of its files, commit history, and branches to your local computer. Cloning allows you to work with the repository locally, make changes, and upload those changes back to the original repository (if you have write access). Cloning is commonly used when you want to contribute to a project or work on it independently. To clone a repository, you need the repository’s URL from your chosen hosting service You can find the repository’s HTTPS URL on the repository page, if you click on the green Code button. Then use the command line to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Then use the git clone command followed by the URL of the remote repository:\n\n GitHub MPIB GitLab\n\n\n\n\n\nCode (HTTPS)\n\ngit clone https://github.com/user-name/repo-name.git\n\n\n\n\n\nCode (SSH)\n\ngit clone git@github.com:user-name/repo-name.git\n\n\nReplace user-name with the repository’s user name and repo-name with the name of the repository.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode (HTTPS)\n\ngit clone https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/user-name/repo-name.git\n\n\n\n\n\nCode (SSH)\n\ngit clone git@git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de:user-name/repo-name.git\n\n\nReplace user-name with the repository’s user name and repo-name with the name of the repository.\n\n\n\nOnce the cloning process is complete, you will have a local copy of the Git repository in the directory you specified. You can now work with the files in the repository, make changes, and commit your modifications locally. Remember to use the appropriate Git commands like git add, git commit, and git push to manage your changes and synchronize them with the remote repository as needed (for details, see the chapter on Git basics). By default, git clone will create a reference to the remote repository called “origin”, so you do not have to use git remote to create a remote repository.\nBefore you make changes to your newly cloned repository you should use the cd command to navigate into it. This step of changing into the repository directory is crucial. Forgetting to do so may lead to confusion, as any Git commands you run will not affect the intended folder but rather the one associated with the current working directory.\nTo clone the repository into a different folder, you can specify the new folder name as an additional “argument” in the git clone command:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit clone https://your-remote-repo-url.git new-folder\n\n\nThis will create a directory named new-folder and clone the repository into it.",

    "section": "8.8 Pulling",
    "text": "8.8 Pulling\nThe git pull command is used to retrieve the latest changes from a remote repository and merge them into your local branch. Effectively, git pull first runs git fetch (see below) to fetch the latest changes from the remote repository and then integrates these changes into the local branch, either using git merge (for details, see the branches chapter) or git rebase (for details, see the section on rebasing), depending on the configuration. In other words, git pull is a git fetch followed by a git merge.\nYou can test this function by editing a file in your repository on GitHub and then use git pull to update your local file with the change made on GitHub. To edit a file, first click on it, in the repository. In the top-right corner of the file view, click on the pencil icon (“Edit this file”) to start editing. Make the necessary changes to the file in the in-browser editor. You can add, modify, or delete content as needed. As you make changes, GitHub automatically tracks your modifications in the editor, displaying them as “changes not staged for commit”. Provide a brief description of the changes in the “Commit changes” section at the bottom of the page.\nNow you can open up your command line once again, and in the relevant directory use the git pull command to update your local file with the change made on GitHub.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit pull\n\n\nIf the pull is successful and there are no conflicts, you should see a message like this:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nUpdating abc123..def456\nFast-forward file.txt | 2 +- 1 file changed, \n1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)\n\n\nThe first part of the message indicates the range of commits that were fetched and merged. In this example, it suggests that Git is updating from commit abc123 to commit def456. The “Fast-forward” message indicates that the local branch could be updated by moving the branch pointer forward, incorporating the new commits from the remote branch. This is possible when the local branch has not diverged from the remote branch, and there are no local commits that the remote branch does not have. The next line shows changes in the file file.txt. The 2 +- indicates that two lines were changed with one insertion and one deletion. The + represents an addition, and the - represents a deletion. The last line of the message provides a summary of the changes. It states that one file was changed, with one line inserted and one line deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe aware which branch you are pulling!\n\n\n\n\n\nA regular git pull incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch. You can use the git branch command to verify which branch you are currently on (for details, see the branches chapter). If the current branch is behind the remote, then by default it will fast-forward the current branch to match the remote. If the current branch and the remote have diverged, the user needs to specify how to reconcile the divergent branches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more: Common git pull command flags\n\n\n\n\n\n--ff-only: Perform a fast-forward merge only. If the remote branch has new changes, Git will only update your local branch if a fast-forward merge is possible. Otherwise, it will abort the pull.\n--no-commit: Perform the pull, but do not create an automatic commit after merging. This allows you to review the changes before committing manually.\n--verbose or -v: Provide more detailed output during the pull operation. This can be helpful for understanding the actions Git is performing.\n--squash: Instead of a regular merge or rebase, squash all the changes into a single commit. This can be useful for cleaning up the commit history or grouping related changes together.\n--autostash: Automatically stash local changes before pulling, then apply them back after the pull is complete. This is handy when you have changes in progress and want to pull in the latest changes from the remote branch.",

    "text": "8.9 Fetching\nThe command git fetch is used to keep up-to-date with changes in the remote repository, without merging them into your local branch. Instead, Git will update all your local tracking branches to the remote branch. That means if you have made changes in your remote repository to a branch, for example called feature, git fetch will leave your local feature branch as it is, but will update your remote tracking branch called: origin/feature. To view your remote tracking branches, you can use git branch -r. After fetching, you can use git switch to review the changes on these branches. If you want to integrate the changes into your local branch, you can either now use git pull to directly update your local branch, or use git merge origin/branchname when you are on your local branch that you want to update.\ngit fetch is arguably the safer option compared to git pull since it retrieves the changes from the remote repository without making any changes to your local working directory and staging area. This allows you to review the changes fetched from the remote repository before integrating them with your local branch.",

However, this usually comes with a few privileges in administering your project that you might not want to share with any random person who would like to contribute to your project. At the same, a central idea of open-source development is that even people who don’t know each other can collaborate together on open-source code. This is where forking comes in: Forking a repository on GitHub allows you to create a personal copy of someone else’s project under your GitHub account and contributing to that project without direct access to the original repository.\nThis copy of the repository includes all files, commit history, and branches and also keeps a reference to the repository it was copied from. Forking is commonly used when you want to contribute to a project but you don’t have direct access to the original repository. It enables you to make changes independently, create new branches, and push modifications to your forked repository. You can also submit changes to the original repository through so-called pull requests which will be explained in more detail below.",

    "text": "9.2 Pull requests\nA pull request (PR) serves as a request for code review and integration into a project’s codebase, enabling collaboration and ensuring code quality before changes are merged. Basically, it’s a way to propose a merge from a branch. Often it’s used to merge changes from a feature branch into the main branch of the repository.\nWhen dealing with pull requests, there are two main workflows: (1) a pull request from a forked repository, (2) a pull request from a branch within a repository. Here’s a breakdown of the components of a pull request:\n\nBase branch: The branch that your changes will be merged into. This is often the main branch.\nCompare branch: The branch containing your changes that you want to merge.\nTitle: A concise description of the changes proposed.\nDescription: A detailed account of the changes, why they’re needed, and any other relevant information.\n\nIn addition, to these basic components, the pull request interface provides sections for reviewers, assignees, labels, and milestones on the right-hand side (see Figure 9.2).\n\n9.2.1 Pull request from a forked repository\nTo create a pull request after forking a repository and making changes, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to your forked repository on GitHub. Make sure you are on the branch that contains the changes you want to propose.\nClick on “Contribute” and then “Open Pull Request”.\nIn the pull request interface, choose the branch you made changes to in your fork (the “compare” branch) and the original repository’s branch where you want to propose your changes (the “base” branch).\nReview the changes.\nClick on the “Create Pull Request” button. Give your pull request a meaningful title and provide a description explaining the changes you made.\nSubmit the Pull Request.\n\nThe owner of the original repository can now approve the changes and thereby merge your repository’s branch into his.\n\n\n9.2.2 Pull request from a branch within a repository\nIn this scenario, contributors work directly within the original repository, creating a new branch for their changes. After completing the changes in the branch, they create a pull request from that branch to the main repository’s default branch (typically main or master). The workflow for this is the same as for opening a pull request for a forked repository. You can see an example pull request within a repository in Figure 9.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Screenshot of a Pull Request on GitHub",

    "text": "9.3 GitHub Flow\nWhen using Git collaboratively, several workflow strategies or “flows” have been developed to manage the development process efficiently. GitHub Flow is popular because it’s simple and it makes sure everyone’s contributions are reviewed and integrated smoothly.\n\n9.3.1 Steps in GitHub Flow\n\nCreate a branch: This step involves branching off from the main project (usually from the main or master branch). The branch should be named descriptively to reflect the work that will be done within it. For details, see the previous chapter on branches.\nMake changes: After creating your branch, you can start working on your project within this new branch. This involves making changes, adding new features, or fixing bugs. It’s recommended to commit your changes regularly with clear and concise commit messages.\nOpen a pull request: Once you have made enough progress on your branch or completed the work, you can open a pull request (PR), as outlined above. This is a way to notify your team that your changes are ready to be reviewed. A PR allows your teammates to see the changes you’ve made and provides a platform for discussing the proposed modifications.\nDiscuss and review your changes: Once you’ve opened a PR, your team will go over your updates, share their thoughts, and recommend any adjustments. This review process is crucial for ensuring the code’s robustness, efficiency, and adherence to the project’s guidelines.\nMerge the branch: After you have been reviewed and your changes validated, your branch needs to be merged back into the main branch. Your work becomes part of the main codebase, and everyone can see the contribution you’ve made.\nPull changes: Finally, everyone updates their own versions of the project with the latest changes from the main branch. This ensures that everyone is working with the most current version, including the changes you’ve just added.\nDelete branch: Once your branch has been successfully merged, it’s time to clean up. Delete the feature branch to maintain a tidy project structure.",

As mentioned earlier, the README file can be created together with your repository or can be added later. In the context of a Git repository, the README file should contain “a description of your repository”. The exact content depends on your repository, but some general things that you might want to include are:\n\nProject description: What function does this repository serve and what are it’s key features?\nInstallation instructions (if applicable): Explain how to install and set up your project, including any dependencies or prerequisites. This is particularly relevant for repositories that contain programming code. Provide clear instructions to help users or contributors get started with your project quickly.\nUsage (if applicable): Provide examples or code snippets demonstrating how to use your project.\nContributing: If you welcome contributions, specify how others can contribute to your project.

This simplifies the process of setting up new projects that share common characteristics or follow best practices. Template repositories have a “Use this template” button on a template repository page, as shown in Figure 10.1.

    "section": "",
    "text": "10.1.1 Importance of Tags\nAt its core, a tag in version control systems like Git is a reference or a label associated with a specific commit. Tags are used to mark particular points in a project’s history, usually to signify important milestones or releases. It acts as a human-readable reference to a particular state of the repository.\nOnce created, a tag is generally immutable It doesn’t move or change its associated commit. Tags don’t store changes themselves. They merely point to an existing commit. Tags should be named in a way that is meaningful and easy to understand. Commonly used names include version numbers (for example, v1.0, a practice known as semantic versioning), release names, or other identifiers that convey the purpose of the tag.\nTags can also be beneficial for collaboration within a development team, as they provide a common reference point for discussing and working on specific versions of the project. Unlike branches, which represent separate lines of development, tags are typically independent of branches. They can be created on any commit, regardless of the branch. Tags are stable references that don’t change even if new commits are added to the repository.\nThere are two types of tags: Lightweight and Annotated tags.\n\n\n10.1.2 Lightweight Tags\nLightweight tags in Git are simple pointers to specific commits in the version control history. Unlike annotated tags, they carry minimal metadata, consisting only of the tag name and the hash of the associated commit. Lightweight tags are created using git tag, followed by the tag name:\n\n1git tag v1.0\n\n\n1\n\nv1.0 is only an example. You can choose any other tag name.\n\n\n\n\nThis creates a lightweight tag named v1.0 that points to the current commit at the time of creating the tag. If you create a lightweight tag in this way (without specifying another commit), it is created at the current commit (HEAD) in your working directory.\nYou can verify that the tag has been created by listing all the tags. To do this, use:\n\ngit tag \n\n\n\n10.1.3 Annotated Tags\nAnnotated tags in Git are tags that include additional metadata beyond a reference to a specific commit. When you create an annotated tag, Git stores information such as the tagger’s name, email, the date the tag was created, and a tagging message. This additional information provides context and details about the tag, making annotated tags more informative compared to lightweight tags. To create an annotated tag, you use git tag with the -a flag. To include a tagging message, the -m flag is used If you do not use the -m flag, your text editor of choice will open up. The tagging message can be a detailed description of the tag, such as release notes or significant changes. For example:\n\ngit tag -a v1.0 -m \"Release version 1.0\"\n\nAnnotated tags are larger in size compared to lightweight tags due to the additional metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon git tag flags\n\n\n\n\n\n-a or --annotate: Creates an annotated tag, which includes additional metadata like tagger information and a tagging message.\n-m or --message: Specifies the tagging message directly in the command. Useful when creating an annotated tag without opening an editor.\n-l or --list: Lists existing tags.\n-d or --delete: Deletes a tag.\n-f or --force: git tag -f v1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.4 Tags workflow\nOnce you created a lightweight or annotated tag, it will show up if you use git tag or git tag -l. To switch to a tag, you can use git checkout followed by the name of the tag:\n\ngit checkout v1.0\n\nNow you are “on the tag” and your working directory reflects the state of the code of the commit the tag is pointing to.\nIn general, it’s not advisable to make changes directly after switching to a tag. When you switch to a tag in Git, you enter a “detached HEAD” state, meaning that you’re not on any branch. In this state, any new commits you make won’t belong to any branch, and you might lose those changes if you switch away from the tag. If you need to make changes based on a specific tag, it’s often better to create a new branch from the tag and then make your changes on that branch.\nA recommended practice is to treat annotated tags as suitable for public releases and lightweight tags as more appropriate for private use. Annotated tags include additional metadata such as the tagger’s name, email, and date, making them valuable for public releases where comprehensive information is beneficial. On the other hand, lightweight tags act as simple “bookmarks” to a commit, serving as efficient pointers without the extra metadata. They are particularly useful for creating quick links to relevant commits in a more private or internal context.\n\n\n10.1.5 Pushing and pulling tags\nPushing and pulling tags in Git involves syncing tags between your local repository and a remote repository, such as GitHub, as discussed in the chapter about remote repositories. To push a specific tag to the remote repository, use:\n\ngit push origin &lt;tag-name&gt;\n\nReplace &lt;tag-name&gt; with the name of the tag you want to push.\nTo push all tags to the remote repository, use:\n\ngit push origin --tags\n\nTo fetch all tags from the remote repository (without merging), use:\n\ngit fetch --tags\n\nAlternatively, you can combine fetching and merging using:\n\ngit pull --tags\n\nWhen you pull or fetch tags, Git fetches tag references, but it does not automatically switch to the state of a specific tag. If you want to work on a specific tag after pulling, use git checkout to switch to that tag.\n\n\n10.1.6 Tagging a previous commit\nSometimes, you may want to create a tag for a commit that is not the most recent one, such as tagging a significant point in your project’s history that was missed earlier. You can easily do this in Git by specifying the commit hash when creating the tag.\nHere’s how you can tag a specific (previous) commit:\n1. Find the commit hash: First, you need to identify the commit you want to tag 1.\n2. Create the tag: Once you have the commit hash, you can create a tag for it. You can create either a lightweight or an annotated tag as discussed earlier. For example:\nLightweight Tag:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit tag v1.0 &lt;commit-hash&gt;\n\n\nAnnotated Tag:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit tag -a v1.0 -m \"Tagging version 1.0 for the old commit\" &lt;commit-hash&gt;\n\n\nReplace &lt;commit-hash&gt;with the actual hash of the commit you want to tag. By following these steps, you can tag any commit in your repository, even if it’s an older one.",

    "text": "10.3 Zenodo\nZenodo is an open-access digital repository platform designed to preserve and share research outputs. It is operated by CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) and supported by the European Commission. Zenodo provides a platform for researchers across various disciplines to deposit, share, and archive their scholarly works, datasets, code, and other research outputs.\nZenodo can be integrated with version control systems like Git and platforms like GitHub. This integration allows for automated archiving of specific releases or tags from Git repositories. Zenodo assigns a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to each record, including those linked to GitHub repositories, providing a permanent link for citation.\nBy linking your GitHub repository, you also ensure that your work is archived and accessible beyond the lifespan of GitHub. When you publish a research paper, journals increasingly require or encourage the deposition of associated data in a public repository. Uploading the contents of your GitHub repository to Zenodo ensures that your work is openly accessible and can be cited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)?\n\n\n\n\n\nA Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a unique alphanumeric string assigned to a digital document or resource to provide a permanent and stable link to it. DOIs are commonly used to identify and provide a persistent link to scholarly articles, research papers, books, datasets, and other types of digital content. The purpose of a DOI is to ensure that the content can be reliably located and accessed over time, even if the web address (URL) of the resource changes.\nKey features of DOIs include:\n\nUniqueness: Each DOI is unique to a particular resource, ensuring that no two resources have the same identifier.\nPersistence: DOIs are designed to remain unchanged, providing a persistent link to the resource even if it is moved or the URL changes.\nInteroperability: DOIs are widely used in scholarly publishing and other sectors, making them interoperable across different systems and platforms.\nAccessibility: DOIs are often associated with metadata that provides information about the resource, such as author, title, publisher, publication date, and more.\nCitations: DOIs are commonly used in academic and scientific citations to provide a standardized and reliable reference to a specific resource.\n\nDOIs are typically assigned and managed by registration agencies, such as CrossRef for scholarly content or DataCite for research data. Organizations and publishers assign DOIs to their digital content to enhance discoverability, citation tracking, and long-term accessibility.\n\n\n\n\n10.3.1 Creating a Zenodo account\nTo upload a Git repository to Zenodo, you first create a Zenodo account. On the Zenodo start page, you can click on “Sign Up” in the top right corner. Here you either can directly use your GitHub account to sign up, or sign up using your email (or other accounts) and link your GitHub account later on. To link your GitHub account, you can click on the arrow, next to your email, on the start page and select “GitHub”. If you create an account on the regular Zenodo site, you will have to create a new account to use the Zenodo Sandbox, since the accounts do not synchronize.\n\n\n10.3.2 Uploading a Git repository\nIf you are just trying out how to upload a Git repository, we recommend to use the Zenodo sandbox, to not create an unnecessary real DOI which is hard to delete. Your Zenodo account should work perfectly fine in the sandbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that you have to link your Zenodo account and sync your repository before you create a new release on GitHub!\n\n\n\nTo upload an older release, you have to download your repository as a .zip file from GitHub and uploading it manually at https://sandbox.zenodo.org/uploads/new\nTo upload a new release, visit the Zenodo GitHub settings. Here you should see all your uploaded repositories, with the option to sync them by selecting the “on” button. If you now create a release, as discussed earlier, it will show up and be associated with a DOI. Please note that if you have created a release before syncing your repository, the release will not show up. You can delete the GitHub release without deleting your tag and create a new release, which is the going to appear on Zenodo.\nFor a pictured guide on how to upload a GitHub repository to Zenodo, you check out this guide from the Code Refinery.\n\n10.3.2.1 Markdown DOI badge\nAfter you have created a release in your synced repo, a DOI badge should show up in your Zenodo GitHub settings next to the repository name. When you click on it there should be a section called Markdown with Markdown syntax below, for example:\n[![DOI](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/badge/731953735.svg)](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/doi/10.5072/zenodo.71301)\n\nYou can copy and paste this syntax into your README.md file on GitHub to create a clickable DOI badge.",

    "text": "11.1 Overview\nGitHub is famous for helping people work together on code. But to work well together, you need to talk and organize tasks. GitHub makes this easy with a feature called GitHub Issues. This chapter shows you how to use GitHub Issues for organizing and following a task.\nGitHub issues are a powerful and often used feature of the platform. Think of the issues for a project as its bug tracker. Even for projects that are not pure software development, we can co-opt this machinery to organize our to-do list more generally.\nThe basic unit is an issue and you can interact with one in two ways. First, issues are integrated into the project’s web interface on GitHub, with a set of options for linking to project files and incremental changes. Second, issues and their associated comment threads appear in your email, just like regular messages (this can, of course, be configured). The result is that all correspondence about a project comes through your normal channels, but is also tracked inside the project itself, with good navigability and search capabilities. For software, issues are used to track bugs and feature requests. In a data analysis project, you might open an issue to flesh out a specific sub-analysis or to develop a complicated figure. In a course, we could use them to manage homework submission, marking, and peer review.\nIssues can be assigned to specific people and they can be labeled, for example, bug, simulation-study, or final-exam. Coupled with the ability to cross-link issues and the project files or file changes, you have the power to document why things have happened in the past and to organize what needs to happen in the future.",

    "section": "11.4 Step-by-step",
    "text": "11.4 Step-by-step\n\n11.4.1 Prerequisites\nTo make an issue, you need a repository. You have the option to use a repository you already have permission to write in, or you can create a new repository. The repository must have issues enabled. If you want more guidance on making a repository, refer to the chapter on first steps with Git. If you need help with turning on issues in case they’re currently turned off in your repository, take a look at the section titled “disabling issues”.\n\n\n11.4.2 Opening a blank issue\nFirst, create a new issue. There are multiple ways to create an issue. You can choose the most convenient method for your workflow. This example will create an issue from a repository on GitHub. For more information about other ways to create an issue, see the section “Creating an issue” in the GitHub documentation.\n\nOn GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. For example, the main page of the GitHub repository of this guide can be found here.\nUnder the repository name, click  Issues (see Figure 11.1).\nOn the following page, click the green New issue button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: “Repo Tabs Issues” taken from the GitHub Docs (docs.github.com). The GitHub product documentation in the assets, content, and data folders are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence (direct link).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it!\n\n\n\nOpen a new Issue in the repository of this online guide (requires a GitHub account).\n\n\nIf the repository uses issue templates (details below), click the green Get started button next to the type of issue you’d like to open (see Figure 11.2). If the kind of issue you want to create isn’t listed among the choices, simply click on “Open a blank issue”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: “Blank Issue Link” taken from the GitHub Docs (docs.github.com). The GitHub product documentation in the assets, content, and data folders are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence (direct link).\n\n\n\n\n\n11.4.3 Filling in issues\n\nChoose a descriptive title for your issue. The title should convey what the issue is about.\nInclude a description that explains why you’re creating this issue and any information that might help to solve it. For instance, if it’s about a bug, explain how to reproduce the bug, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened. You have the option to use Markdown to add special formatting, links, emojis, and other things. For more information, see the section “Writing on GitHub” in the GitHub documentation.\nYou can also attach files or images by dropping, selecting or pasting them into the issue.\nWhen you’re done, click the green Submit new issue button. You can still edit any of the fields after creating the issue.\n\nOn the right-hand side, you’ll see options to assign someone to the issue, add labels, add the issue to projects, or add the issue to milestones. We’ll explore these features in more detail below. You can also set all of these options after you submitted the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: “Issue Title Body” taken from the GitHub Docs (docs.github.com).

    "section": "11.5 Features of Issues",
    "text": "11.5 Features of Issues\n\n11.5.1 Editing issues\nYou can always edit the title and description of your issue after you submitted the issue.\nOn the right side of the title, you’ll notice an Edit button. This comes in handy if you ever need to change the title of the issue as the discussion evolves over time or you want to make the title more descriptive. Even if you edit the issue, the issue number will always remain the same.\nWhat if you decide to modify the main text of your issue or a comment after you’ve submitted it? No problem at all. Once your issue is submitted, a blue bar will appear at the top of your comment. This bar displays your username and the comment’s date. Toward the right side of this blue bar, you’ll notice three dots (). If you click on those dots, you’ll find the option to edit your comment.\n\n\n11.5.2 Communicating in issues\n\n11.5.2.1 Commenting issues\nThe major benefit of issues is that they serve as platforms for conversations with yourself and others. Once an issue has been submitted, you can continue the conversation by adding more comments within that issue. For example, you might ask a question, and someone else could respond with a solution or idea. They might even include links to related issues or external resources that could be helpful.\n\n\n11.5.2.2 Mentioning people\nYou can also mention people in issue comments using the @ symbol. Anyone who is part of the repository will automatically receive email notifications about new comments. Tagging specific users with the @ symbol will also send them an email, making it a useful way to involve individuals who might not already be closely following the entire repository. In a public repository, you can tag any GitHub user, while in a private repository, they need to have appropriate permissions.\nTo connect related issues in the same repository, you can type # followed by part of the issue title and then clicking the issue that you want to link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: “Issue Comment” taken from the GitHub Docs (docs.github.com). The GitHub product documentation in the assets, content, and data folders are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence (direct link.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.5.2.3 Timeliness of issues\nWhenever a new comment is added to the issue thread, a new date will be displayed in the blue bar at the top of the issue. This provides a convenient way to assess the timeliness of ongoing discussions.\n\n\n11.5.2.4 Referencing comments\nAnother useful feature is the ability to click on the date of an issue’s comment, causing the URL in your browser to update. This updated URL lets you link directly to a particular comment in the issue thread. This is very handy when you want to share a specific comment with someone, saving them the trouble of scrolling. Alternatively you can also you can also click on the three dots on the right of the blue comment header () and select the option to copy the link for that specific comment.\n\n\n11.5.2.5 Using Markdown syntax\nGitHub allows you to use Markdown syntax in your issue comments, which provides an easy way of formatting text. For example, you can create headers using the # symbol (# Header 1, ## Header 2, and so on). For a complete overview of Markdown syntax, you cn check out this GitHub documentation.\n\n\n\n11.5.3 Adding a task list\nOne way of using Markdown syntax in GitHub issues, is creating a task list. It can be helpful to divide big problems into smaller tasks or group related issues together. A task list is a set of tasks that each appear on a separate line with a clickable checkbox. You can select or deselect the checkboxes to mark the tasks as complete or incomplete. You can make a task list by putting - [ ] in front of list items. You can refer to other issues using their number or URL. You can also use plain text to keep track of tasks without issues and turn them into issues later if needed. For more information, see the section “About task lists” in the GitHub documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: “Issue Task List Raw” taken from the GitHub Docs (docs.github.com). The GitHub product documentation in the assets, content, and data folders are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence (direct link).\n\n\n\n\n\n11.5.4 Adding labels\nAdd a label to categorize your issue. You can apply labels to an issue on the right side of the issue thread or when creating a new issue (see Figure 11.6). For example, you could apply a bug label and a good first issue label to indicate that an issue is a bug that a first-time contributor could tackle. Users can filter issues by label to find all issues that have a specific label. For example, you can find a list of issues for this repo here. For information, see the section “Managing labels” in the GitHub documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.6: “Issue With Label” taken from the GitHub Docs (docs.github.com). The GitHub product documentation in the assets, content, and data folders are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence (direct link).\n\n\n\n\n11.5.4.1 Creating a label\nAnyone with write access to a repository can create a new label or customize existing labels.\n\nOn GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.\nUnder the repository name, click  Issues or  Pull requests.\nAbove the list of issues or pull requests, click Labels.\nTo the right of the search field, click New label.\nUnder “Label name”, type a name for your label.\nUnder “Description”, type a description to help others understand and use your label.\nOptionally, to customize the color of your label, edit the hexadecimal number, or, for another random selection, click .\nTo save the new label, click Create label.\n\n\n\n\n11.5.5 Adding milestones\nYou can add a milestone to track the issue as part of a higher-order project target. A milestone will show the progress of the issues as the target date approaches. For more information, see the section “About milestones” in the GitHub documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.7: “Issue Milestone” taken from the GitHub Docs (docs.github.com). The GitHub product documentation in the assets, content, and data folders are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence (direct link).\n\n\n\n\n\n11.5.6 Assigning the issue\nTo clearly communicate responsibility for an issue, you can assign the issue to a team member of your project or organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.8: “Issue Assignees” taken from the GitHub Docs (docs.github.com). The GitHub product documentation in the assets, content, and data folders are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence (direct link.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.5.7 Adding projects\nYou can add the issue to an existing project and populate metadata for the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.9: “Issue Project” taken from the GitHub Docs (docs.github.com). The GitHub product documentation in the assets, content, and data folders are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence (direct link.\n\n\n\nLearn more about projects\n\n\n11.5.8 Issue templates\nGitHub issue templates are predefined formats for creating new issues in a repository. They help with the process of opening new issues by providing a structure for the information that contributors should include when reporting a bug, requesting a feature, or any other type of issue. You can create multiple templates for different types of issues, such as bug reports, feature requests, or general inquiries Each template is a Markdown file (.md) with predefined sections, such as description, steps to reproduce, expected behavior, actual behavior, etc.\nWhen a user opens a new issue, GitHub automatically displays the template content in the issue description field. Users can then fill in the required information based on the template.\nTo create a new template follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to the repository on GitHub.\nClick on the Settings tab.\nUnder the General tab, in the Features section, find the Button labeled: Set up templates\n\nHere you will find predefined templates by GitHub, but also the option to create a new issue template from scratch.\n\n\n11.5.9 Linking to an issue\nYou can link to an issue directly from the command line! You can link a pull request, branch or commit to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when the pull request, branch or commit is merged. For example:\n\ngit commit -m \"Add a new file. close #7\" \n\nThis closes issue number 7 of your repository. (if committed to the default branch)\n\n11.5.9.1 Linking to an issue using a keyword\nYou can link to an issue by using a supported keyword in the pull request’s description or in a commit message. The pull request or commit must be on the default branch. Possible keywords are:\n\nclose\ncloses\nclosed\nfix\nfixes\nfixed\nresolve\nresolves\nresolved\n\nFor further information, see this chapter of the GitHub docs.\n\n\n\n11.5.10 Disabling issues\nIf you want to disable issues for your repository, you can easily do this in your repository’s settings.\n\nNavigate to the repository on GitHub.\nClick on the Settings tab.\nUnder the General tab, in the Features section, find the checkbox related to issues.\nUncheck or disable the issues feature.",

It’s helpful to think about why you’re using them.\n\n11.6.1 Issues for bug reporting and feature requests\nIf you’re using Issues for typical things like reporting and fixing problems in code or adding new features, it’s a good idea to keep the project open to the public. You can have all the discussions related to that project inside it.\n\n\n11.6.2 Issues for internal conversations\nIf you’re using Issues for internal conversations (for example, discussions within a research group), you might want to keep the repository private at first. But here’s something to consider: Do you plan to make the project public when you’re ready to share your research with the world? Changing a project from private to public (or the other way around, which you can do in the project’s settings) not only makes the code and files public but also all the discussions in the Issues. That’s okay, but it adds some things to think about in terms of what’s being talked about in those discussions.",

    "text": "11.7 Scientific use cases for Issues\nIssues aren’t just for software development - they can also be very useful in various situations of scientific research. Here are some ways Issues can help in a research context:\n\n11.7.1 Organizing tasks\nResearchers can use Issues to break down complex research projects into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, you can create an Issue for each experiment, analysis, or data collection task. By labeling and assigning these tasks, you ensure that all team members are aware of what needs to be done and who is responsible for each task.\n\n\n11.7.2 Tracking reviewer comments and changes\nWhen preparing a paper for publication, you often receive comments from multiple reviewers. You can use Issues to track these comments by creating a separate Issue for each set of reviewer comments. Each comment can be linked to specific changes in the manuscript, making it easy to ensure that all feedback is addressed. For instance, you can link a commit or pull request to a specific reviewer’s Issue, providing a clear record of how and when their feedback was incorporated.\n\n\n11.7.3 Labeling for busy PIs\nResearch group leaders (or principal investigators, PIs) who work with multiple researchers across multiple projects can use labels to quickly categorize Issues based on their priority or type. For example, labels like urgent or needs-review can help PIs prioritize their time and ensure that critical tasks are addressed promptly.\n\n\n11.7.4 Facilitating peer review\nIn collaborative projects, especially in academic or scientific settings, Issues can be used to manage peer review. Different reviewers can be assigned to specific Issues, and labels can be used to track the progress of each review. For instance, you might have labels like in-review, approved, or revisions-needed to indicate the status of each task.\n\n11.7.4.1 Example: Linking reviewer comments to changes in a paper\nImagine you’re revising a manuscript based on reviewer comments. You can create an Issue for each reviewer’s comments and link specific comments to corresponding changes in the manuscript. This might look like:\n\nIssue #12: Reviewer 1 Comments\nComment 1: \"Clarify the methodology section.\"\nAction: [Link to commit that updates the methodology section]\nIssue #13: Reviewer 2 Comments\nComment 2: \"Add more references to related work.\"\nAction: [Link to commit that adds additional references]\n\nThis approach ensures that all reviewer comments are addressed and provides a clear history of how the manuscript was revised in response to feedback.",

They show your project’s history, branches, and changes in a more colorful and easy-to-understand manner.\nGUIs make Git appear less scary and more accessible to everyone, helping you manage your code, without the hassle of remembering complex text-based commands in the command-line. While Git GUIs offer a user-friendly approach to version control, they come with a few limitations. One notable drawback is their reduced flexibility compared to the command-line interface. GUIs are designed to simplify common tasks, but more advanced or customized operations may be challenging to perform within a graphical environment. Despite their user-friendly design, understanding the underlying Git concepts and the specific workflow of a GUI is still very important.\nAs this book primarily emphasizes learning Git through the command line interface, this chapter will only feature a short introduction, but not extensive tutorials for GUI tools.",

    "text": "12.2 Popular Git GUIs\nThere is a wide variety of Git GUIs available, and each of them offers its own set of features and benefits, catering to different preferences and workflows. In this section, we will focus on GitHub Desktop and GitKraken, although many more options exist. For a more comprehensive overview, you can explore the official Git website.\n\n12.2.1  GitHub Desktop\n\n12.2.1.1 Download\nGitHub Desktop is a desktop application developed by GitHub. It is free to download for macOS and Windows on the GitHub website. There is currently no official version available for Linux.\n\n\n12.2.1.2 Setup\nAfter you download and install the program, you will be required to log in using your GitHub account. Once logged in, you can select a repository to work on, either from GitHub or a local repository (as shown in Figure 12.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: Screenshot of GitHub Desktop. Showing the start screen.\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve picked a repository to work on, GitHub Desktop shows you the history of that repository in a visual way. You’ll see branches, commits, and tags displayed on a timeline in chronological order. This setup makes it easy to dive into version control tasks like handling branches, commits, changes, and pull requests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Screenshot of GitHub Desktop. Showing an example repository.\n\n\n\nFor a more extensive GitHub Desktop tutorial, you can check out the GitHub documentation.\nGitHub Desktop’s interface is simple and user-friendly. Its primary advantage lies in its integration with GitHub. However, this dependency can also be limiting if you’re looking to work with repositories on alternative Git hosting services.\n\n\n\n12.2.2  GitKraken\n\n12.2.2.1 Download\nGitKraken is a third-party program and another very popular Git GUI for Windows, macOS and Linux. You can download it from the official website. Normally, GitKraken only offers a free seven-day trial period. However, if you are a student, you can get it for free, through the GitHub Student Developer Pack.\n\n\n12.2.2.2 Setup\nAfter downloading, you either begin to track a local repository or log in to a hosting website like GitHub (but also to other ones) and work with your repositories from there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Screenshot of GitKraken. Showing the start screen.\n\n\n\nAfter choosing a repository to track, you will see a visual representation of the commit history, branches, and commits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: Screenshot of GitKraken. Showing an example repository.\n\n\n\nJust like with GitHub Desktop, your are able to manage your branches, push to or pull from remote branches and commit changes through GitKraken.

    "text": "12.3 Use cases for Git GUIs\nYou can perform a wide range of basic and advanced Git operations with GUIs. Here, we present a few Git use cases where the use of a GUI can be particularly helpful as compared to doing the same thing from the command-line.\n\n12.3.1 Partial commits\nOne useful feature of Git GUIs is the ability to easily commit only specific parts or “hunks” of code from within a file. This is particularly handy when you’ve made changes to different parts of a file and want to commit them separately to group related changes together and keep a clean commit history. With a Git GUI, you can easily select the lines or blocks of code you want to include in a commit, stage them, and then commit just those changes.\nFor example, to do this in GitKraken, change a file, then click on your last commit in the GitKraken GUI (see Figure 12.5). You will see a list of unstaged files with changes. After you click on one, you will see your additions highlighted green and your deletions highlighted red. If you hover over the changed lines you will see the option to “Stage this Line”. To stage multiple lines at the same time, highlight the ones you want to stage, do a right-click and select “Stage selected lines”. You can also stage the whole file or “hunk” and unstage specific changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.5: Screenshot of Rstudio. Showing staging an example file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more: What is a hunk?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Git, a “hunk” refers to a distinct block of code changes within a file. It represents a cohesive set of added, modified, or deleted lines in a specific location. Git automatically divides changes into hunks to facilitate easier review, selective staging, and conflict resolution during version control operations.\n\n\n\nYou can also create a partial commit in GitHub Desktop. For details, see the GitHub Desktop documentation.\n\n\n12.3.2 Merge conflict resolution\nGit GUIs make resolving merge conflicts more intuitive. When conflicts arise due to incompatible changes made in different branches, a GUI helps you identify conflicting lines side by side. You can then select which changes to keep, discard, or modify. The graphical representation simplifies the process.\nTo merge two branches in GitKraken, you can either drag and drop one branch onto another branch or use the right-click menu of the branch you want to merge in. If a merge conflict occurs you will see a list of conflicted files. When you click on a file, it will show you a side-by-side comparison of the conflicting changes, allowing you to choose which lines to keep. After resolving all conflicts, you can continue the merge process by completing the merge commit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.6: Screenshot of Gitkraken. Showing an example merge conflict.",

After choosing this, you have the option to clone a Git repository, for example from Github.

Showing the options for loading a repository.\n\n\n\nAfter cloning a remote repository or opening a local Git repository folder, you can do things like committing, pushing or switching branches using buttons in Rstudio, instead of using the command line. The Git tab within the upper right panel enables you to stage, commit, push and pull changes. The branches tab in the Git pane displays a list of available branches, making it straightforward to switch between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.8: Screenshot of Rstudio. Showing an example repository.\n\n\n\nClicking “Commit” will open up a window, where you see your changes marked with colors. You also easily write commit message and have the option to amend your last command. It is also possible to stage specific lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.9: Screenshot of Rstudio. Showing an example commit.\n\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive tutorial on using Git in Rstudio you can check out the “Happy Git and GitHub for the useR” by Jenny Bryan.\nYou should keep in mind that while the RStudio GUI simplifies many Git tasks, it lacks the flexibility and customization of using the command line. But considering you can also open a command line tab in RStudio, the GUI might be a help in your workflow, if you work on a  project and track it using Git.",

    "section": "13.2 Removing changes or files",
    "text": "13.2 Removing changes or files\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe careful about data loss!\n\n\n\nThis section introduces Git commands that may delete changes in your repository beyond recovery. Especially if you apply them for the first time, take your time and only execute a command if you are certain about its consequences. Better yet, experiment with these commands in a separate test repository, not in a repository where you keep your most important work.\n\n\n\n13.2.1 Discarding changes in the working directory\nSometimes you might want to revert files back to the state of your last commit. For example, this can be useful when you realize that the recent changes you made to a file have introduced an error. You can use git restore to discard changes in the working directory and revert the files to the state they were in when you last committed them.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit restore &lt;FILE&gt;\n\n\nIt is also possible to revert all files in your repository to the state of your last commit using:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit restore .\n\n\n\n\n13.2.2 Unstaging files\nYou can also use git restore with the --staged flag to unstage files, you have previously added to the staging area. This can be useful when you accidentally staged files or want to reorganize your commit.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit restore --staged &lt;FILE&gt;\n\n\nTo remove all files from the staging area use:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit restore --staged .\n\n\n\n\n13.2.3 Deleting files\nIf you want to delete files from your computer and your Git repository, you can use the git rm command. This command removes files from your working directory and automatically stages this change for your next commit. The workflow would go like this:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit rm &lt;FILE&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit commit -m \"Delete file &lt;FILE&gt;\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more: Common git rm flags\n\n\n\n\n\n-f or --force: This flag forces the removal of files, even if they are modified.\n-r or --recursive: Use this flag to remove directories and their contents.\n--cached: This flag removes files from the staging area but preserves them in the working directory.\n-n or --dry-run: With this flag, Git will only show you what would be removed but will not actually perform the deletion.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.2.4 “Untracking” files\nSometimes, you may have files in your Git repository that you no longer want to track or include in future commits, but want to keep in your local filesystem. It makes sense to include these files in a .gitignore file, as discussed in the chapter on first steps with Git. You could also use git rm in combination with the --cached flag.\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit rm --cached &lt;FILE&gt;\n\n\n\n\n13.2.5 Reverting commits\nThe git revert command is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes made in a previous commit. It’s a way to safely reverse the effects of a specific commit without actually removing that commit from the commit history. It requires specifying the commit hash you want to revert. To look at the hashes of your commits, you can use the git log command, as described in the chapter on first steps with Git. If you have a specific commit that you want to revert, you would use a command like:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit revert &lt;commithash&gt;\n\n\nThis will create a new commit that effectively undoes the changes made in the specified commit. This new commit will have the opposite changes, effectively canceling out the changes from the original commit. You might need to resolve a merge conflict, if the changes you want to revert conflict with changes in subsequent commits. By default the commit message will be revert &lt;commit message of reverted commit&gt;. However, Git will open an editor for you to change this message, if you don’t specify it otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more: What are hashes?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Git, a commit hash, also known as a commit ID or SHA-1 hash, is a unique identifier for a specific commit in a Git repository. It’s a 40-character hexadecimal string that represents the contents and history of that commit. Each commit in a Git repository has a unique hash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more: Common git revert flags\n\n\n\n\n\n-n or --no commit: Prevents Git from automatically creating a new commit after reverting changes. It stages the changes, allowing you to make additional modifications or review them before committing.\n-m &lt;parent-number&gt;: When dealing with a merge commit, this flag specifies which parent commit to use as the source for reverting. By default, Git uses the first parent (main branch), but you can specify another parent by providing its number.\n--no-edit: This flag prevents the text editor from opening for editing the commit message, making it useful when you want to keep the default commit message.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.2.6 Resetting to a commit\nIf you want to reset your repository to a commit that was made in the past, you can use the git reset command.\nTo get an overview of your past commits you can either use git log or git reflog. Both commands should get you an overview of your past commits. For example:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit log --oneline\n\n\nwill give you an output like:\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n25a51e8 Update README.md\nb7f3a12 Add new feature X\n8d76a45 Merge branch 'feature-branch'\n2f0e73b Implement new functionality\n\n\nUsing git reset &lt;commit&gt; will undo all the changes you made after the specific commit you picked. Your “branch pointer” will move to the specified commit, and changes after that commit will be uncommitted and moved back to the working directory. For example:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit reset 8d76a45\n\n\nHowever, these changes are still present in your working directory, so if you want to discard them completely, you can use add the --hard flag:\n\n\n\nCode\n\ngit reset --hard &lt;commithash&gt;\n\n\nThis will not only reset your “branch pointer” but also discard all changes in your working directory and staging area since the specified commit. It effectively resets your working directory to the state of the chosen commit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe careful about data loss!\n\n\n\nPlease be careful when using the git reset --hard command! This command reset your working directory to the state of the chosen previous commit. This will delete changes beyond recovery, unless you can retrieve these changes from another location, for example a remote repository like GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more: git log vs. git reflog\n\n\n\n\n\ngit log shows the commit history, while git reflog shows a log of all changes to branches, including resets and other adjustments. Think of git log as a timeline of commits, and git reflog as a detailed diary of all recent changes, even those that alter commit history, providing a safety net for recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more: Common git reset flags\n\n\n\n\n\n--soft: Resets the branch pointer to the specified commit but keeps changes staged. This allows you to rework the changes and create a new commit.\n--mixed (default): Resets the branch pointer to the specified commit and unstages changes. Changes are kept in your working directory, allowing you to modify them before committing.\n--hard: Resets the branch pointer to the specified commit, unstages changes, and discards changes in your working directory. Use with caution, as it can lead to data loss.\n--merge: Resets the branch pointer and the index to the specified commit, but keeps changes in your working directory. This is useful in aborting a merge.\n--keep: Resets the branch pointer and index to the specified commit but refuses to do so if there are uncommitted changes in the working directory.\n--patch or -p: Allows you to interactively choose changes to reset, similar to the git add -p command for staging changes.",

    "text": "13.3 Purging a file from your repository’s history\nLet’s say that you accidentally added a large file to a previous commit. Now you want to remove the file but keep all commits that came afterwards.\nFor example, this could be the case if you committed sensitive data as a binary file. You will need to remove the file from the history, as you can’t modify it to remove or replace the data.\n\n13.3.1 git filter-repo\ngit filter-repo is a very useful tool that is not part of the official Git distribution. It is a third-party tool and is designed to be used alongside Git for more advanced repository history manipulation tasks.\nTo illustrate how git filter-repo works, we’ll show you how to remove your file with sensitive data from the history of your repository and add it to .gitignore to ensure that it is not accidentally re-committed.\n\n13.3.1.1 Installation\nSince git filter-repo is not a part of standard Git, you will need to install it first. You can install git-filter-repo manually or by using a package manager. For example, to install the tool with HomeBrew on macOS, use the brew install command.\n\nbrew install git-filter-repo\n\nFor more information on installation, see INSTALL.md in the newren/git-filter-repo.\n\n\n13.3.1.2 Clone a fresh copy of the repository\nIf you don’t already have a local copy of your repository with sensitive data in its history, clone the repository to your local computer.\n\n1git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME&gt;/YOUR-REPOSITORY\n\n\n1\n\nReplace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username and YOUR-REPOSITORY with the name of your GitHub repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.1.3 Navigate into the repository’s working directory\nNavigate into the repository’s working directory. For details on folder navigation in the command line, see the “Command Line” chapter.\n\n1cd YOUR-REPOSITORY\n\n\n1\n\nReplace YOUR-REPOSITORY with the name of your GitHub repository. For details on the cd command, see the “Command Line” chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.1.4 Running git filter-repo command\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you run git filter-repo after stashing changes, you won’t be able to retrieve your changes with other stash commands. Before running git filter-repo, we recommend unstashing any changes you’ve made. To unstash the last set of changes you’ve stashed, run git stash show -p | git apply -R. For more information, see Git Tools - Stashing and Cleaning.\n\n\nLet’s say that you accidentally committed (and pushed) a file you actually don’t want to share because it contains sensitive data. After you installed the git filter-repo tool, you can use it to exclude a specific file from you commit history.\nRun the following command, replacing PATH-TO-FILE-YOU-WANT-TO-REMOVE with the path to the file you want to remove, not just its file name. These arguments will do the following:\n\nForce Git to process, but not check out, the entire history of every branch and tag\nRemove the specified file, as well as any empty commits generated as a result 1- Remove some configurations, such as the remote URL, stored in the .git/config file. You may want to back up this file in advance for restoration later.\nOverwrite your existing tags\n\nEssentially, git filter-repo will modify your entire Git repository history to exclude the specified file (PATH-TO-FILE-YOU-WANT-TO-REMOVE). The --invert-paths flag inverts the selection, so it keeps everything except the specified path, effectively removing the file from the entire history of the repository. If you do not use --invert-paths, the command would only keep the specified file in your repository, discarding everything else.\n\n1git filter-repo --invert-paths --path PATH-TO-FILE-YOU-WANT-TO-REMOVE\n\n\n1\n\nReplace PATH-TO-FILE-YOU-WANT-TO-REMOVE with the path to the file** you want to remove, not just its file name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI did not clone a fresh copy of the repository. Is this a problem?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you did not clone a fresh copy of your repository, you may see this message after running the git filter-repo command:\n\nAborting: Refusing to destructively overwrite repo history since\nthis does not look like a fresh clone.\n  (expected freshly packed repo)\nPlease operate on a fresh clone instead.  If you want to proceed\nanyway, use --force.\n\nAs described in the message, you have two options:\n\nClone a fresh copy of your repository and execute the command there.\nAdd --force to proceed with the existing repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.1.5 Add your file to .gitignore\nAdd your file to .gitignore to ensure that you don’t accidentally commit it again. You can edit .gitignore in your favorite text editor.\n\n1echo \"PATH-TO-FILE-YOU-WANT-TO-REMOVE\" &gt;&gt; .gitignore\ngit add .gitignore\ngit commit -m \"Add YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA to .gitignore\"\n\n\n1\n\nThis command writes PATH-TO-FILE-YOU-WANT-TO-REMOVE inside the .gitignore file. &gt;&gt; makes sure that this is written to a new line inside the .gitignore file.\n\n\n\n\nDouble-check that you’ve removed everything you wanted to from your repository’s history, and that all of your branches are checked out.\n\n\n\n13.3.2 BFG\nInstead of using git filter-repo it is also possible to use the open source tool BFG repo cleaner. The tool is especially useful if you need to remove very large files from your commit history.\n\n\n13.3.3 Force-push your local changes to GitHub\nIf you are happy with the state of your repository, force-push your local changes to overwrite your repository to GitHub, as well as all the branches you’ve pushed up. A force push is required to remove sensitive data from your commit history.\nWhen you perform a force push, you are essentially overwriting the existing commit history on the remote branch with the new commit history from your local branch. So instead of adding changes to your commit history, like with a normal push, a force push changes or discards the existing commit history on that branch. To do a force push, you use git push together with the --force flag. The --all flag is used to push all branches that have corresponding branches on the remote repository, that way you are updating multiple branches at once.\n\ngit push origin --force --all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError: fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you receive this error message?\n\nfatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\n\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights\nand the repository exists.\n\nAs described above, this could mean that origin was removed from your repository. Configure origin again using either SSH or HTTPS:\n\nSSHHTTPS\n\n\n\n1git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY\n\n\n1\n\nReplace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username and YOUR-REPOSITORY with the name of your GitHub repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git\n\n\n1\n\nReplace &lt;YOUR-USERNAME&gt; with your GitHub username and &lt;YOUR-REPOSITORY&gt; with the name of your GitHub repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to remove the sensitive file from your tagged releases, you’ll also need to force-push against your Git tags:\n\ngit push origin --force --tags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dangers of force pushing\n\n\n\n\n\nAs stated in this example, force pushing can be very useful, for example if you committed and pushed data you want to remove again. However force pushing comes with potential drawbacks and should mostly be used as a last resort.\nForce pushing can lead to the loss of commit history on the remote branch, which may cause confusion or conflicts for collaborators who have based their work on the previous history. Force pushing to a shared branch can cause conflicts for collaborators who have already cloned the repository and pulled changes. Once a force push is executed, the old commit history may become difficult to recover.\nEspecially if you collaborate with others on your repository, let them know in advance that you are force-pushing to your common remote repository.",

After using either the BFG tool or git filter-repo to remove the sensitive data and pushing your changes to GitHub, you must take a few more steps to fully remove the data from GitHub.\n\nContact GitHub Support, asking them to remove cached views and references to the sensitive data in pull requests on GitHub. Please provide the name of the repository and/or a link to the commit you need removed.\nTell your collaborators to rebase, not merge, any branches they created off of your old (tainted) repository history. One merge commit could reintroduce some or all of the tainted history that you just went to the trouble of purging.\nAfter some time has passed and you’re confident that BFG / git filter-repo had no unintended side effects, you can force all objects in your local repository to be dereferenced and garbage collected with the following commands (using Git 1.8.5 or newer):\n\n\ngit for-each-ref --format=\"delete %(refname)\" refs/original | git update-ref --stdin\n\n\ngit reflog expire --expire=now --all\n\n\ngit gc --prune=now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can also achieve this by pushing your filtered history to a new or empty repo.",

[renv 0.17.3]\n* This project contains a lockfile, but none of the recorded packages are installed.\n* Use `renv::restore()` to restore the project library.\n\nThis output tells you that (1) renv was automatically installed and loaded, (2) the renv environment for the project was loaded, and (3) that none of packages recorded in the renv lockfile are installed.\nThe renv lockfile captures the state of the package library of the project at some point in time. It is defining the version of renv used when generating the lockfile, the version of  used in that project, the R repositories that were active when the lockfile was created and the package records defining each  package, their version, and their installation source.

This empowers users to create reproducible documents and reports, as the code needed for generating the output is embedded within the document and automatically executed during rendering.\nHowever, in this guide, we usually only want to display code but not execute it! We therefore need to disable code execution in the YAML header of each Quarto document.\nThe YAML header in a Quarto document is used to specify important metadata and settings for the document. It is typically placed at the top of the document enclosed between three dashes (---) to separate it from the main content. The YAML header provides instructions to the Quarto rendering engine on how to process and present the document.\n\n\n\n\n\nReference external code\nYou can reference external code.

Line-based annotations provide a way to attach explanation to lines of code much like footnotes.\n\nFor example, this is a code annotation for the git status command:\n```{bash}\ngit status\n```\n1. `git status` displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.",
